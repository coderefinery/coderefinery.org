## Objectives

We are working with **students, researchers, and research software engineers
from all disciplines** to advance FAIRness of software management and
development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop,
review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.


## Infrastructure services

Our [code repository hosting service](/repository/) is open and free for all
researchers based in Nordic universities and research institutes. Please
[contact us](/get-involved/#contact-us) if you would like to use these services.


## Training opportunities

We offer training opportunities to researchers from Nordic research groups and projects
to learn basic-to-advanced research computing skills and become confident in using
state-of-the-art tools and practices from modern collaborative software
engineering.


### Membership with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)

Since November 2018, [NeIC](https://neic.no) is a [platinum
partner](https://carpentries.org/members/) to [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org), an international project that comprises
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and [Data
Carpentry](https://www.datacarpentry.org), communities of instructors,
trainers, maintainers, helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach
foundational computational and data science skills to researchers.

With this we have access to:

- 6 [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) in the Nordics each year. The workshop fee is on us, only the instructor travel is on the host institution.
- 15 seats in the [Carpentries instructor training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) each year.

Carpentry workshops last 2 days.  Software Carpentry workshops include
introductory lessons on Unix shell, version control with Git and
programming in Python or R. Data Carpentry workshops are usually
tailored to specific scientific disciplines. An overview of Carpentry
curricula can be [found here](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/)

Please [get in touch](/get-involved/) if you would like to host a Carpentry workshop or become an instructor.


#### Level of Carpentry workshops

Carpentries workshops focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for
learners with no or little digital skills while our three day workshops are the next
step.
For beginners who don't yet write code but want to get started, we
highly recommend attending a [Software Carpentry workshop](https://software-carpentry.org).


### CodeRefinery Workshops

The key objective of CodeRefinery workshop is to grow researchers' software
best practices skills to facilitate open and reproducible research.

#### In-person workshops

We offer **three-day workshops** that focus on methods to build
modular, reusable, maintainable, sustainable, reproducible, testable, and
robust software.  These workshops are based on [training material](/lessons/)
we develop and maintain.

#### Online workshops

Since April 2020, we also offer **online workshops**. Each online
workshop focuses on one lesson from our [training material](/lessons/)
and takes place during one or two 3-hour sessions in an online meeting
room.


#### Requesting a workshop

Would you like to host a CodeRefinery workshop at your home institution?
[Get in touch](/get-involved/#contact-us) if this sounds interesting!

Note that even though CodeRefinery is a Nordic project, we are interested in giving workshops
also outside the Nordics and are able to do so provided that funding for travel and
accommodation can be covered.

#### Information for local organizers

We have prepared [a list of practical requirements](../../workshop-requirements).


#### Level of CodeRefinery workshops

For CodeRefinery workshop, it is assumed that participants already write code
for their research but no expertise is required.  Some experience in navigating
the file tree and editing files in a terminal session is recommended.

[Our workshops](/workshops/) are attended by MSc and PhD students, postdocs,
researchers and more senior staff from a wide range of scientific backgrounds
and with different programming experiences.


### Instructor training workshops

One purpose of our Instructor training workshops is to train
CodeRefinery instructors, but being (or becoming) a CodeRefinery
instructor is not required. With the workshops we also aim at building
partnerships with [research software engineers](https://nordic-rse.org)
and researchers who are willing to lead skills' transfer within their
local communities in the Nordics.

Instructor training workshops take 2 days and cover [this lesson
material](https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/).

#### Level of Instructor training workshops

Learners should have some familiarity with good software development
practices, especially in the context of scientific software, and be
interested in sharing knowledge and teaching.

### Other types of events

We have organized hackathons, get-together events and shorter workshops
customized for individual research groups. Regularly we also host
online Open House events where CodeRefinery instructors together with
a wider community of interested people work in sprints on topics
ranging from lesson development to website updates.

We're always interested in new collaborations, so if you would like to
co-organize an event with us or suggest a new type of event, don't
hesitate to [get in touch](/get-involved/)!
