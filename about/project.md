## Objectives

We are working with **students, researchers, and research software engineers
from all disciplines** to advance FAIRness of software management and
development practices so that research groups can collaboratively develop,
review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.


## Infrastructure services

Our [code repository hosting service](/repository/) is open and free for all
researchers based in Nordic universities and research institutes. Please
[contact us](/get-involved/#contact-us) if you would like to use these services.


## Training opportunities

We offer training opportunities to researchers from Nordic research groups and projects
to learn basic-to-advanced research computing skills and become confident in using
state-of-the-art tools and practices from modern collaborative software
engineering.


### Membership with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)

Since November 2018, [NeIC](https://neic.no) is a [platinum
partner](https://carpentries.org/members/) to [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org), an international project that comprises
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and [Data
Carpentry](https://www.datacarpentry.org), communities of instructors,
trainers, maintainers, helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach
foundational computational and data science skills to researchers.

With this we have access to:

- 6 [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) in the Nordics each year. The workshop fee is on us, only the instructor travel is on the host institution.
- 15 seats in the [Carpentries instructor training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) each year.

Please [get in touch](/get-involved/) if you would like to host a Carpentry workshop or become an instructor.


#### Level of Carpentry workshops

Carpentries workshops focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for
learners with no or little digital skills while our three day workshops are the next
step.
For beginners who don't yet write code but want to get started, we
highly recommend attending a [Software Carpentry workshop](https://software-carpentry.org).


### CodeRefinery Workshops

The key objective of CodeRefinery workshop is to grow researchers' software
best practices skills to facilitate open and reproducible research.

We offer **three-day workshops** that focus on advanced methods to build
modular, reusable, maintainable, sustainable, reproducible, testable, and
robust software.  These workshops are based on [training material](/lessons/)
we develop and maintain.


#### Level of CodeRefinery workshops

For CodeRefinery workshop, it is assumed that participants already write code
for their research but no expertise is required.  Some experience in navigating
the file tree and editing files in a terminal session is recommended.

[Our workshops](/workshops/) are attended by MSc and PhD students, postdocs,
researchers and more senior staff from a wide range of scientific backgrounds
and with different programming experiences.


#### Our train the trainer program

Our train the trainer program aims at building partnerships with [research
software engineers](https://nordic-rse.org) and researchers who are willing to
lead skills' transfer within their local communities in the Nordics.
