## Confirmation email

After filling out the registration form you will receive an automatic
confirmation email but please note that your registration is only tentative
until we confirm it with another (human-written) email which should happen
typically within a week.


## Waiting list

We maintain a waiting list for seats but this is currently not automatic so we
need this short time buffer to manually confirm participants and inform those who
are on the waiting list.


## First come, first serve

The seats are assigned on a first come first serve basis but we need to also
make sure that registered participants are affiliated with a Nordic academic
institution since the course is free for participants and financed by the
Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (unless this is an event outside of Nordics
funded by a different organization).


## Cancellation

We ask confirmed participants who are not able to participate at the course
they have signed up for, to inform us as soon as possible so that people on the
waiting list can take the vacant seat.


## Questions?

If you have any questions about your registration status, please write to
[support@coderefinery.org](mailto:support@coderefinery.org).
