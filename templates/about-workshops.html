        We organize a roadshow of hands-on interactive three-day workshops across
        the Nordics with type-along presentations and live coding where short
        tutorials alternate with practical exercises.

        We are also actively engaged in The Carpentries and can help set up
        and/or teach Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshops.

          <h4>CodeRefinery workshops</h4>
          <p>
            CodeRefinery workshops aim grow researchers' software best practices
            skills and to consolidate knowledge learnt during Carpentries
            workshops or from prior experience. The focus is on professional
            tools for efficiently developing and maintaining research software.

          <h4>Software and Data Carpentry</h4>
          <p>
            Carpentry workshops teach foundational coding and data science skills
            and focus on raising awareness about tools that researchers can learn
            to speed up their research. As members of the Carpentries, we can
            give access to Carpentries instructor training workshops and help set
            up Carpentry workshops.

          <h4>Instructor training</h4>
          <p>
            Instructor training workshops focus on how to teach technical
            topics in general and CodeRefinery lessons in particular. Key
            pedagogical ideas and teaching methods are covered, as well as what
            learners need to know in order to teach CodeRefinery lessons.

          <p>
            We occasionally teach, organize or participate in other types of
            events. This includes hackathons, get-together events with
            knowledge sharing and networking, or dedicated shorter workshops
            focusing on a particular topic. Get in touch if you want to
            co-organize an event with us!
