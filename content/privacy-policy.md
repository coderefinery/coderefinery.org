Your data only comes from what you decide to provide to us. You will never be
affected by this data except as given here.

## Data we collect

- Registration data for workshops.
- Email addresses of persons who filled out the contact form to be notified of
  "upcoming workshops near you".
- Post-workshop survey results.


## Who we share the data with

- Pre- and post-workshop survey data is stripped of person-identifiable information and reported on our website.
- We keep contact addresses separately, which we do not share with anybody, for future workshop announcements.


## Where we store the data

- Anonymized survey results are or will be published on
  [https://github.com/coderefinery](https://github.com/coderefinery).
- Names and email addresses of participants are stored on a zero-knowledge
  encrypted Git repository.
- We use [https://indico.neic.no](https://indico.neic.no) to register
  participants for workshops but we don't control this data. However,
  registering via [https://indico.neic.no](https://indico.neic.no) is not
  strictly required to take part in the workshop.


## How long we store the data

- Anonymized survey results are meant to be kept without a time limit.
- We always keep affiliations and academic position long term for reporting.
- Stored names and email addresses of participants will be removed with the end
  of this project (2021-10-31).


## Anonymity and right to be forgotten

- You have the right to register to a workshop anonymously.
- If you want to be removed from announcement lists, please [let us
  know](/get-involved/#contact-us).
- Workshop registration can be canceled before and removed, otherwise we keep
  it for survey.
- If you want access to your data or to be removed, email us from the address
  you have used for registration.


## Questions/concerns?

- If you believe something is wrong, please [let us know](/get-involved/#contact-us).
- You have the right to lodge complaint with supervisory authority.
