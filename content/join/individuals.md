As individuals, there are plenty of ways to join CodeRefinery,
regardless of what you do now.  Also see what [professional
staff](@/join/staff.md) and [organizations](@/join/organizations.md)
can do.

For any of these, you can get started by [joining a
meeting](@/join/meetings.md) and say hi, especially the "community
calls" on the first of each month.  Or [join our
chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/) and introduce
yourself in the "#new members" stream.  Or contact anyone you know for
a recommendation on how to get involved - we aren't that formal yet.

Our chat has all kinds of interesting facts and help, so hanging out
there will probably teach you something anyway.

Read more: [roles
overview](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/roles-overview/) for
all the varying responsibilities in a workshop (surely there is
something for you there)


## As a learner

Anyone may attend our workshops, and this is a great way to get
started.  If you want to do more than just attend, join our chat and
give feedback during the workshop.


## As an exercise leader

Even during your first workshop, you could register as an exercise
leader and help others, as part of a
[team](@/workshops/teaching-style.md#teams).  This is actually not
that hard, you aren't expected to know anything, instead you are more
focus on keeping a good flow and welcoming environment.  There are
other expert helpers to help you.  If you are comfortable enough with
the pre-requisites and aren't too scared by error messages, you can do
it!  We have some [basic onboarding
training](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/exercise-leaders/)
for you!

Maybe you want to bring all the rest of your research group as your
team?


## As a co-instructor or expert helper

We don't teach alone, and thus it's remarkably easy to get started as
an instructor!  In fact, we almost recommend it as a starting point,
since it's good to have a co-instructor that understands the difficulty
of doing and learning the topics.

If teaching isn't for you, there are plenty of staff helpers at every
workshop.


## Lesson contributions

We would love to see more contributions to our lessons. We are a normal open
source project on GitHub, and you can contribute via issues, pull requests, or
by discussing in our [chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/).  You
are welcome to [reuse our lessons as well](@/lessons/reusing.md)

A good starting point is to either open a topic on our
[chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) or to open an issue on one of the
lesson repositories in our [GitHub
organization](https://github.com/coderefinery) where you can describe what you
would like to change to collect feedback and possibly also contributors.

No contribution is too small and ideas for changes are very often very good
ideas and we would love to work with you on making our lessons better and more
modular and even more relevant.


## Help out the CodeRefinery project itself

As an open project, there are always things to do to keep us running!
We're especially interested in people who know how to grow a
community, do better communications, or manage many events better than
we do now.


## Joining CodeRefinery as an individual

Currently there is no formal joining, hang out in meetings/chat and
offer suggestions, and you can call yourself a part of CodeRefinery.
Create a pull request to add yourself to
[contributors](@/about/contributors.md) after significant
activity/commitment, or ~1 year of activity in general.
