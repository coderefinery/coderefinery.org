As individuals, there are plenty of ways to join CodeRefinery,
regardless of what you do now.

For any of these, you can get started by [join a
meetings](@/join/meetings.md) and say hi, especially the
"community calls" on the first of each month.  Or [join our
chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/) and introduce
yourself in "new members".  Or contact anyone you know for a
recommendation on how to get involved - we aren't that formal yet.


## As a learner

Anyone may attend our workshops, and this is a great way to get
started.  If you want to do more than just attend, join our chat and
give feedback during the workshop.


## As an exercise leader

Even during your first workshop, you could register as an exercise
leader and help others, as part of a
[team](@/workshops/teaching-style.md#teams).  This is actually not
that hard, you aren't expected to know anything, instead you are more
focus on keeping a good flow and welcoming environment.  There are
other expert helpers to help you.  If you are comfortable enough with
the pre-requisites and aren't too scared by error messages, you can do
it!  We have some [basic onboarding
training](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/exercise-leaders/)
for you!


## As a co-instructor or expert helper

We don't teach alone, and thus it's remarkably easy to get started as
an instructor!  In fact, we almost recommend it as a starting point,
since it's good to have a co-instructor that understands the difficulty
of doing and learning the topics.

If teaching isn't for you, there is also being a helper at a workshop.


## Help out the project itself.

As an open project, there are always things to do to keep us running!
We're especially interested in people who know how to grow a community
or do better communications than we do now.
