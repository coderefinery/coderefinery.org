If you support computational research, lead a team to join our
courses!  Don't forget you can do everything on the [for
individuals](@/join/individuals.md) page as part of your job, and
[your whole organization could join](@/join/organizations.md).

## Run your own breakout rooms and/or provide local support

The idea is simple: you form a team to attend a workshop.  You watch
the main stream however you want (in a meeting room or online), and we
have "exercise breaks" where your team works locally under your
guidance.  The teaching is "free" and you can focus on local,
impactful support and mentoring.

Our workshops are designed with this in mind, and it's one attendance
option at our own universities.  We try to provide clear guides (as
best we can), and are happy to have you join our channels to
coordinate.  You don't have to be an expert, you can learn at the same
time.  Read more about [local
advertisement and breakout
rooms](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/local-breakout-rooms/).

For any of these, you can get started by [join a meeting](@/join/meetings.md)
and say hi, or [join our chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/)
and introduce yourself in the "#greetings" or specific workshop stream.

## Advertise our events to your audience

Letting your local audience know about our events is a simple way to
provide a high-impact training opportunity to your community (no
effort needed on your part).  Many of our workshops are online and
live-streamed, so anyone can attend.


## Request in-person workshops

This is currently somewhat on hiatus, since our online workshops [work
so well](@/workshops/teaching-style.md), but you could [request your
own workshop](@/workshops/request.md).
