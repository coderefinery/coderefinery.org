join us!  Don't forget you can do everything on the [for
individuals](@/join/individuals.md) page, too.

## Advertise our events to your audience

Letting your local audience know about our events is a simple way to
provide a high-impact training opportunity to your community with
little work on your side.  Many of our workshops are online and
livestreamed, so anyone can attend.

## Run your own breakout rooms and/or provide local support

Go one step beyond simple advertising: organize your local community.
We call this "distributed registration" and basically means that you
collect your own registration, organize people into teams (if
desired), set up in-person on online spaces to watch the course and do
the exercises.  We can support you however possible, for example more
chat support, training exercise leaders, and you can join our planning
meetings.

For any of these, you can get started by [join a
meetings](@/join/meetings.md) and say hi, especially the
"community calls" on the first of each month.  Or [join our
chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/) and introduce
yourself in "new members".  Or contact anyone you know for a
recommendation on how to get involved - we aren't that formal yet.

## Request in-person workshops

This is currently somewhat on hiatus, since our online workshops [work
so well](@/workshops/teaching-style.md), but you could [request your
own workshop](@/workshops/request.md).
