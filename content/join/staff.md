## Run your own breakout rooms and/or provide local support

Go one step beyond simple advertising: organize your local community, organize
people into teams (if desired), set up in-person on online spaces to watch the
course and do the exercises together.

We can support you however possible, for example more chat support, training
team leaders, and you can join our planning meetings.  Read more about [local
advertisement and breakout
rooms](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/local-breakout-rooms/).

For any of these, you can get started by [join a meeting](@/join/meetings.md)
and say hi, or [join our chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/)
and introduce yourself in the "#new members" stream.  Or contact anyone you
know for a recommendation on how to get involved - we aren't that formal yet.

## Advertise our events to your audience

Letting your local audience know about our events is a simple way to
provide a high-impact training opportunity to your community with
little work on your side.  Many of our workshops are online and
live-streamed, so anyone can attend.


## Request in-person workshops

This is currently somewhat on hiatus, since our online workshops [work
so well](@/workshops/teaching-style.md), but you could [request your
own workshop](@/workshops/request.md).
