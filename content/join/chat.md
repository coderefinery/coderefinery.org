We use [Zulip](https://zulip.com) to discuss within our team and community.

You don't need an invite to join our [Zulip
chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) - simply sign up and join.

This is the place where we discuss lesson development, plan events, share
lessons learned and new tools and tricks, and where we ask and answer questions
about computing and programming. No question is too simple. Drop by and ask and
talk with us!  You can listen in, follow certain threads, participate, and
influence. [Learn how CodeRefinery uses
it](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/).
