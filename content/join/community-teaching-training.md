Want to learn about the [CodeRefinery teaching
style](@/workshops/teaching-style.md)?  Want to be able to run your own
workshop as a livestream and invite others to attend.  Want to join
forces to make teaching more open, accessible, and available?  Attend
our community teaching training.

Our **community teaching training** recognizes that in the connected
era, teaching doesn't have to be a solitary or small team affair.
CodeRefinery's workshops are done as a broad team with many diverse
roles, and this allows us to reach a huge number of people.

* **Tools of teaching:** how to make the most out of online (and
  other) teaching - basic teaching hints, co-teaching, livestreaming,
  etc.

* **Workshop organization, collaboratively:** our vision of teaching
  together outside of our silos, and how it works in practice.

* **Socio-technical factors:** social and technical barriers to
  learning, why you need to care, and what you can do about them.

* **Lesson development, collaboratively:** how to design lessons and
  teaching materials so that they can be open and shared.

Courses are offered as we need to (contact us if you want one),
usually around once a year - but really, right now we onboard most
people to our style by working together.

"Community teaching training" is much more broad and doesn't duplicate
the [Carpentries instructor
training](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/) - attending both
is useful.

The material can be found at [Community teaching
training](https://coderefinery.github.io/community-teaching/).
