CodeRefinery is a collaboration between different organizations (most
are universities or research computing infrastructure providers), and
you can join!


## Provide CodeRefinery workshops to your community

Joining as an organization isn't that different than [what is
described on the staff page](@/join/staff.md), but you can do so even
more systematically and take part in decision-making about what
workshops we offer and when.


## Do your own teaching better

Do you need to teach and reach a broader audience?  Do you put on your
own workshops?  Join CodeRefinery, learn our teaching strategies, and
let's do better together.  Plenty of technical staff (who aren't
primarily teachers) need to teach as part of their jobs, and this is
the kind of community that CodeRefinery provides.


## Provide your workshops to the CodeRefinery community

You might offer some of your own workshops to be livestreamed to a
wide audience, and we will help you to develop the workshop and do the
streaming - including finding many expert co-instructors to help with
the writing and teaching.  This exchange of teaching also leads to
lots of other technical skill exchange, which is excellent for your
staff skills as well.


## Relation to The Carpentries

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is another well-known
organization that provides teaching.  Compared to them, we are more
intermediate- and advanced-level, and focus on accommodating existing
teaching needs, rather than putting a huge amount of effort into
long procedures to making a few lessons perfect.  Lessons and
workshops are primarily maintained and managed by the different
partners, and we focus on teaching and pedagogy collaboration.


## Joining CodeRefinery as an organization

In the future, there will be some way to officially join CodeRefinery
as an organization, but that will come when it's time.  For now, if
you express interest, you can join almost immediately and help figure
out the way we will work later.  Currently, you could consider
yourself a partner if (criteria are subject to change):

- You have at least one staff member who has a significant interest in
  teaching intermediate-level practical skills in scientific computing.
- You have some staff who follows CodeRefinery meetings + activities.
- You [help out](@/join/individuals.md) with CodeRefinery workshops in
  proportion to your resources, possibly offering some of yours to a
  wider audience.
- You open a pull request adding yourself to the [partners
  page](@/about/partners.md)
