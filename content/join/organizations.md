CodeRefinery is a collaboration between different organizations (most
are universities or research computing infrastructure providers), and
your organization can join!

## Provide CodeRefinery workshops to your community

Joining as an organization isn't that different than [what is
described on the staff page](@/join/staff.md), but you can do so even
more systematically and take part in decision-making about what
workshops we offer and when.


## Do your own teaching better

Do you need to teach and reach a broader audience?  Do you put on your own
workshops? Join CodeRefinery, learn our [teaching
strategies](https://coderefinery.github.io/community-teaching/), and let's
improve our events together.  Plenty of technical staff (who aren't primarily
teachers) need to teach as part of their jobs, and this is the kind of
community that CodeRefinery provides.


## Open up your workshops to the CodeRefinery community

You might offer some of your own workshops to be live-streamed to a
wide audience, and we can help you to develop the workshop and do the
streaming - including finding many expert co-instructors to help with
the writing and teaching.  This exchange of teaching also leads to
lots of other technical skill exchange, which is excellent for your
staff skills as well.

## Joining CodeRefinery as a partner/sponsor

In the future, there will be some way to officially join CodeRefinery
as a sponsor, but that will come when it's time.  For now, if
you express interest, you can join almost immediately and help figure
out the way we will work later.  Currently, you could consider
yourself a partner if (criteria are subject to change):

- You have at least one staff member who has a significant interest in
  teaching intermediate-level practical skills in scientific computing.
- You have some staff who follows and is interested in contributing to
  CodeRefinery meetings + activities.
- You [help out](@/join/individuals.md) with CodeRefinery workshops in
  proportion to your resources, possibly offering some of yours to a
  wider audience.
- You open a pull request adding yourself to the [partners
  page](@/about/partners.md).
