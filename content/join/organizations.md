CodeRefinery is a collaboration between different organizations, and
you can join!

Joining as an organization isn't that different than [what is
described on the staff page](@/join/staff.md), but you can do so even
more systematically and take part in decision-making about what
workshops we offer and when.  You might offer some of your own
workshops to be livestreamed to a wide audience, and we will help you
to develop the workshop and do the streaming - including finding many
expert co-instructors to help with the writing and teaching.  This
collaboration is quite education and is a great way to network and
share knowledge.

In the future, there will be some way to officially join CodeRefinery
as an organization, but that will come when it's time.  For now, if
you express interest, you can join almost immediately and help figure
out the way we will work later.
