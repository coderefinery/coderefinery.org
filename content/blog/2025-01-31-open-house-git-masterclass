## Outreach 

We reached out to the community during different events, in several RSE chats (including the CodeRefinery Zulip chat) and via social media with a variation of this text: 

```
Are you teaching Git?

Come to our Open House session on Tuesday Jan 14 and discuss with few people who
are interested in how a lesson could look like which goes beyond basic Git.

Let's share materials, find the gaps in the curriculums and collaborate to fill these gaps. 

Connection details and agenda: XXX

## Goal for the session

During the introduction sessions we collected everyones goals to make this session as useful as possible for everyone: 

- That we all know about materials that we already have; if we decide to develop some new material, we ideally don't re-invent the same things in
- Awareness and knowledge exchange, starting the discussion
- Gather some initial thoughts and ideas, make connections - know where to look when the time comes!
- I think there is definetely a need for an advanced course especially when it comes to certain features
- Share experiences, contribute to discussion, find contributors to the curriculum above?
- Here in order to take the CR Git lesson to a more advanced level
- See in what ways we can add to the exiting material / what might be missing
- See what is out there; improvement of our advanced Git course
- See in what ways we can add to the exiting material / what might be missing
- Share what I think failed in our intermediate workshop, discuss a list of topic and their justifications (backward lesson design), and some philosophical questions about this in particular
- Mainly listen and I hope for a more advanced course+reference after coderefinery (maybe something to inspire people)
- Discover existing materials and work towards collating these into a single open, community maintained material. Refine what is 
- Identify plans and allies to contribute my materials to a community-based effort
- I want to learn how to teach more effectively, especially to people who are not approaching this from an IT background 

TODO: Formulate to something common

## Material collection

TODO: Collect all links from the notes with short descriptions and author/owner, license, and status. 

## Topic collection

TODO: Collect all topics with notes from the notes document, can be ordered differently than in notes

## Gap identification

TODO: Collect the identified gaps

# Outlook

In this session, we looked back: we shared experiences and links to already existing materials. We also preliminary identified topics of interest to the community based on previous experiences. 
For the next session, we aim to **look into the future: What lessons are missing, where do we put them and how do we collaborate** on something useful for the community to mix and match as needed. 
If you want to be part of this discussion, please XX.
