Registration and managing learners can be hard when there are hundreds
of them, but if you plan out a course well, it's manageable.

In a small course, you register and people come, and everything else
gets figured out from there.  When you have more than a hundred people
coming, perhaps with pre-made [teams](TODO:LINK),
registration can be much, much harder.  Luckily, if
you plan the course considering that registration will be a major
task, it can work out OK.

## Basic registration strategies

**Basic registration** would be easy: you let people sign up, they can
get emails.  Since we
[livestream](@/blog/2022-11-14-livestreaming-courses.md), people can
even attend without registering, which we think is important (providing
personal data is not necessary to attend - this is by design).
Registering allows someone to receive emails, and it's relatively easy
to send different emails to different groups if desired (for example,
those from our university get information on our local
online/in-person exercise sessions).

At Aalto University, this is what we have done for most online
courses, and it works well.

## Registration including teams

If we want to provide [teams](TODO:LINK) as a service, things get more
involved.  The main idea of registering including teams is that we want
to make them pre-arranged and the constant day-after-day.  We also want to
provide an exercise leader for each team (again the same one each day).
The in-person equivalent to that is "sit at a table with at group, that group
is your team".  Our online version is much harder than this, since we
need to pre-plan a lot more.  We *could* emulate this by randomly assigning
Zoom breakout rooms on day 1, and then ask people to join the same one
each day.  But, we think that part of the benefit is assigning similar
teams (if you know someone, you are with them) and having it clear
that rooms *will* stay the same day-after-day.


So, to do this teams online, our registration system needs to:
* Accept the normal registration
* Know a little bit about people to assign them to suitable teams (if
  desired).
* Provide a way for people to indicate pre-made teams.
* Provide a way for us to see the information above easily and assign
  the teams ...
* ... and then send everyone a customized email with their team's room
  number
* And be able to quickly update this information based on last-minute
  changes, send people new info, and not get overwhelmed with this
  job.

This, especially the last one, turns out to be exceptionally hard.  We
are working on ways to make this better:
- point1
- point2
- point3

## Distributed registration

The livestream and [reverse
hybrid](@/blog/2022-11-07-reverse-hybrid.md) approaches allow another
option: **distributed registration**.  With this idea, we don't need a
central registration (or if we do, it can be only for general
information), and we let each local partner run a registration that
includes the teams - and let them deal with that locally in a smaller
and more manageable form.


## Summary

We did a lot of great things with [teams](TODO:LINK), but it was a lot
of work back then, and is still a lot of work now.  Anyone running a
large course (that goes beyond "infodump to an audience") should
carefully consider how to make this manageable.
