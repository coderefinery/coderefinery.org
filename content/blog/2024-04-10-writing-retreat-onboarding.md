In order to provide newcomers to the CodeRefinery community a good experience that inspires them to stay we need to create a welcoming atmosphere and provide a good onboarding.

Currently, our onboarding procedure varies from case to case. The team at in-person meeting are mainly in-kind contributions to the project that joined the project on own incentive (usually after a workshop) or by being sent by their managers. Everyone got at least one personal meeting with the project manager, which introduced them to whatever was needed at the time. One thing that many of the team mentioned was that they wish they had gotten more introduction to the Zulip chat. ( More on improvement suggestions in the community blog post).

Team members generally agreed that active participation an interest in strategy and availability to help/teach makes them part of the CodeRefinery team.
Everyone present felt well onboarded.

- What should be easy accessible information on website that could make people interested in being onboarded as X? (pre-onboarding info)
    -  What do I get in return
    -  How do I get started, I am interested what is next
      -  Responsibilities
    - "I have only half a day this month, where can I help which will be meaningful?"
    
- In a perfect world where everything is possible, money and time is not an issue, how would onboarding look?
  - join community call
  - one manual page which gives overview
  - a video that explains how to join
  - each new member gets a mentor/buddy who mentors for a while and is their main contact and who connects them to other people
  - In person event
  - co-teaching with a mentor (as one option)

- Do we need more defined "roles" so that onboarding can be more task specific? (also upvote +1 /downvote -1 for options you like)
>Currently: 
> - core team (onboarding via team meeting and personal chat with Radovan?),
> - trainers (get personal onboarding if asked for before the workshop, no further community engagement), 
> - helpers (onboarding before each workshop, no further community engagement), 
> - "everyone in chat" (get what they get from website and whoever told them to join)

- Missing roles
  - Ambassadors (was something I was asked about recently)
  - Local organizers (who are often also ambassadors)
  - Training coordinators in other projects/orgs (who might also be ambassadors)
  - Board
  - Contributors
  - Heroes
- Q&A with previous ambassadors about their experience, video?
- have welcome package
- info sessions at different community events (research community)
    - EGU
- CodeRefinery network
    - cross institution network, ambassador can show you around, rotary club
- why would someone become an ambassador?
