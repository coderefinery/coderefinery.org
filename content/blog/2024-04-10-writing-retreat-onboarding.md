- How were you onboarded?
    - f2f/zoom+1
    - Attended the Monday meetings and learned everything there
    - There was no onboarding, participated in a in-person workshop directly after participting in few meetings. There was an internal mail about the availability of the possition and a boss proposed I should check it out
    - I volunteered as a team leader when Radovan gave a git lecture to our research group.
    - Invited CR to host Espoo workshop at Aalto one year, started teaching there at the next one

- What did you learn late that you wish you had learned during onboarding?
    - Probably something Zulip-related +1
        -  overwhelming
            -  What can we do about it?
                -  "look at recent topics" only, "mark everything as read"
                -  "If you click only the stream you'll see messages in chronological order but topics vary. Click a topic to read the conversation"
                -  clearer structure (2 workshop streams, separate lesson streams) -> clean up, archive something
                -  explain to new people which stream is for what
                -  create own Zulip dashboard? -> mute/unmute
                -  have 1 hour session how do people use Zulip?
                -  
        -  Basically I just joined all channels and was like what is all this :eyes: eg. I did not know what "Advent of Code" was
        -  
    - ...

- What makes you part of the "core team"? Would you call it something else than core team?
    - "Board" and "Contributors" and "Heroes"
    - Active participation.
    - Active participation and awareness of about curent activities. Available to help and/or teach 
    - I don't even know whether I can be considered part of the "core team"
    - Broad interest in setting strategy
    - .

- Do you feel well prepared to be a CodeRefinery 
    - core team member?
        - Yes - oooooo
        - No -
        - Not sure - o
    - trainer?
        - Yes - oooo
        - No -
        - Not sure - 
        - very soon I will - o
    - helper?
        - Yes - ooooo

        -
- What should be easy accessible information on website that could make people interested in being onboarded as X? (pre-onboarding info)
    -  What do I get in return
    -  How do I get started, I am interested what is next
      -  Responsibilities
    - "I have only half a day this month, where can I help which will be meaningful?"
    
- In a perfect world where everything is possible, money and time is not an issue, how would onboarding look?
  - join community call
  - one manual page which gives overview
  - a video that explains how to join
  - each new member gets a mentor/buddy who mentors for a while and is their main contact and who connects them to other people
  - In person event
  - co-teaching with a mentor (as one option)

- Do we need more defined "roles" so that onboarding can be more task specific? (also upvote +1 /downvote -1 for options you like)
>Currently: 
> - core team (onboarding via team meeting and personal chat with Radovan?),
> - trainers (get personal onboarding if asked for before the workshop, no further community engagement), 
> - helpers (onboarding before each workshop, no further community engagement), 
> - "everyone in chat" (get what they get from website and whoever told them to join)

- Missing roles
  - Ambassadors (was something I was asked about recently)
  - Local organizers (who are often also ambassadors)
  - Training coordinators in other projects/orgs (who might also be ambassadors)
  - Board
  - Contributors
  - Heroes
- Q&A with previous ambassadors about their experience, video?
- have welcome package
- info sessions at different community events (research community)
    - EGU
- CodeRefinery network
    - cross institution network, ambassador can show you around, rotary club
- why would someone become an ambassador?
