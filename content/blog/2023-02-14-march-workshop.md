Our March workshop is soon.  By now, many of you know what a
CodeRefinery workshop is - git (intro and collaborative), social
coding, reproducible research, Jupyter, documentation, testing, and
modular code development ([check all
material](@/lessons/_index.md)).  But what's less
known is all the new ways to take part.

**[Workshop page](https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/)
and [Register](https://indico.neic.no/e/coderefinery-march-2023)**

In case you didn't know, we teach via livestream - which means anyone
can attend and we have unlimited capicity.  Our [teaching
style](@/workshops/teaching-style.md) (as far as we can tell, quite
unique to us!) makes the courses still engaging while allowing us to
reach a much larger audience than we could otherwise.  We also offer
some in-person or Zoom attendance options.

As an **individual**, you can attend - by yourself watching the
livestream, apply to work together in a Zoom team we organize, or some
local partners will even have in-person rooms to attend.  Registration
is **not** binding, sign up for information and come when you can (you
won't take a seat from others).  **To simplify registration, you can
just sign up and you'll get contacted about Zoom/in-person
possibilities later.**

**If you have some friends, work together!** Book your own meeting
room and watch the livestream together.  We provide hands-on exercises
that on which you can work together - or even try to apply the
techniques to your own projects during this exercise time.  Working
with a friend seriously improves learning and uptake after the
workshop.

**If you've been to CodeRefinery before, why not volunteer?** (For any
of these, sign up in the normal registration form and tick the
interested in being staff/observer box):

* Be a team leader to allow us to support more teams (register in the
  normal form and indicate this interest there).
* Be a co-instructor: thanks to our
  [co-teaching](@/blog/2022-10-31-co-teaching.md), we've reduced the
  barrier to get started.  In fact, someone that has taken
  CodeRefinery once would make a perfect co-instructor for a lesson,
  since you'll remember what it was like to be a learner and act.
* We can always use volunteers to follow up on HackMD questions, help
  manage Zoom, communications, and generally all the other little
  things that need doing.

Why volunteer?  You'll learn more of the workshop contents and get
involved in our teaching network - really good for both your career
and your organization.

More than anytime before, CodeRefinery is about being accessible to as
many learning styles as possible.  Anyone can register and you'll get
information, you can decide if you want to watch the livestream,
review videos later, or just be aware of what happened and check again
later.

We hope to see you there!
