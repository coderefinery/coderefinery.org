If you haven't noticed, CodeRefinery livestreams it's workshops (see
refs below).  We can reach a virtually unlimited number of people and
easily make recordings for later, yet our co-teaching and Collab notes
system still makes a workshop that feels interactive and fun to
attend.  **Does anyone want to learn how to do this yourselves?**

## A workshop idea

Richard Darst has been doing most of the streaming and would like to
teach others.  Richard can host people in Helsinki, Finland for some
workshop, or if people fund travel somewhere else we can host it
there.  A workshop would include:

- Basic streaming theory
- Setting up [OBS-Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for streaming
- Recording and publishing videos rapidly (by the same night, every
  time).
- How to make a livestream course lively (co-teaching, Collab Notes,
  lesson design, screenshare style)
- Time to test and practice all of the above.
- Improving our documentation

Most of the above is in theory documented in the [CodeRefinery
manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/), but reading is hard
and seeing by example with mentoring is easy.

An ideal host would be an EU or regional computing competence center,
open science organization, or someone interested in teaching innovation,
who can host a public workshop, and be able to help in advertising the
workshop to other interested parties.  (This could be tried online, but
when we are setting up computers to do the screencapture of a meeting,
while also doing another meeting to share that screen capture... it
might get a bit complex.)

Contact us at scip@aalto.fi or support@coderefinery.org, or via the

OBS isn't that hard:<br>
