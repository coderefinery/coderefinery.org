*This is the index page of the [Future of
Teaching](/blog/2022/10/17/future-of-teaching/) series.*


In early 2020, global teaching got disrupted by the Covid-19
pandemic.  Countless courses struggled to maintain interaction and
teaching, but CodeRefinery found that by embracing the times, our
teaching could become even better.  **This series of blog posts will
discuss what we did and how you can learn from it.**

So, what is the future of teaching?  For type of practical, hands-on
learning, we could try to classify learning situations into three
types:
* Very large courses and massive open online courses (MOOC),where
  individual interaction isn't possible.
* Small-medium courses, 10-30 people, with traditional classroom-type
  interactions.
* One-on-one or small-group mentoring.

Before Covid, CodeRefinery was in the middle category with exclusively
in-person classroom sessions over a few days.  During Covid, we
focused on very large online courses, which incidentally corresponded
with the rise of Research Software Engineering services in some of our
communities.  This produced an interesting effect: **The middle layer
got squeezed out**: very large courses (with the proper tools) were
better at conveying information, and mentoring and co-working was best
for supporting people outside of these courses.  These two things
combined seemed to greatly reduce the need for traditional
medium-sized courses.  At the same time, the total effort became less
as we scaled up, which we'll talk about later.

Of course, you can't move medium in-person courses to large online
courses without adjusting how you teach.  However, once we did adjust,
we were quite happy.  We want to take some time in these posts to
informally discuss what we did, sort of as a guide to the other
information which can be found in [our
manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/).

The strategies we have developed have revolutionized the way we teach.
We no longer have limited attendance because of room sizes, mandatory
registration, or instructor monologues.  We don't want to "return to
normal", and we think that others should start learning of our
developments as well.

But we realize that not everyone can go all the way that we have gone.
It takes a lot of effort to put on a livestream course with tens of
staff (but still many of our strategies can be adapted by others).
Medium-sized courses are still great for medium-sized communities and
provide a good way for a few people to reach an audience - especially
if it is local.  We hope to explore the ways that what we have learned
can be adapted to this kind of teaching, too.  And of course, we will
continue supporting medium sized courses where someone wants them,
especially as a "reverse hybrid" with remote instructors but in-person
exercises.
