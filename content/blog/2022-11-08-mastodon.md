For the obvious reasons, CodeRefinery is looking into a Mastodon
account.  You can now find us at
[@coderefinery@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/web/@coderefinery).

We will try to mirror to both, at least for the time being.  If anyone
has ideas about how balance the two, please let us know.  We will have
the CodeRefinery account follow other staff and interesting people
related to CodeRefinery's mission, so if you are looking for other
interesting people to follow to seed your network, check that out,
too.
