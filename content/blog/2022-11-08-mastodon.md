For the obvious reasons, CodeRefinery is looking into a Mastodon
account.  You can now find us at
[@coderefinery@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@coderefinery).

We will try to mirror to both, at least for the time being.  If anyone
has ideas about how balance the two, please let us know.  We will have
the CodeRefinery account follow other staff and interesting people
related to CodeRefinery's mission, so if you are looking for other
interesting people to follow to seed your network, check that out,
too.

Mastodon is part of a federated social network, open source, and not
under the influence of big companies - just what we should be
supporting more of.  Interested in joining yourself?
- <https://mastodon.help> gives a basic introduction of the how and
  why.  <https://fedi.tips/> gives a longer FAQ (and a separate
  introduction).
- Usernames are like emails with a username and a server name,
  `@username@server.name`.
- To join, you choose a server that you feel comfortable in, and they
  all communicate.  Some recommendations are below.
- You can follow anyone regardless of their server, but the server you
  choose might affect what you see in the local timelines (for
  example, an art-focused server will probably have more stuff
  interesting to artists).  Later, it's easy to move and automatically
  redirect your followers.
- When in doubt, just join somewhere that looks reasonable - don't let
  the Paradox of Choice hold back progress!

If you are just joining, you can start out by following CodeRefinery -
copy `@coderefinery@fosstodon.org` to your search and follow it.  You
may be interested in following some of the people that we follow to
seed your list.

Deciding a server:

- We chose <https://fosstodon.org> (FOSS = "free and open source
  software") to focus on the software and technology side of things.
- For others in academia or research,
  <https://fediscience.org/server-list.html> is a very nice list of
  other interesting servers.
- <https://mastodon.social/> is run by the non-profit that coordinates
  the Mastodon open-source project, but that does *not* mean you
  should necessarily prefer it.
- Do a web search for server lists.  There are both news articles with
  broad recommendations, and searchable lists with many servers for
  specialized topics.

What you should know about Mastodon (especially vs. Twitter):
- It isn't designed to feed you content via internal algorithms: you
  have a much more active role in determining what you see.  You need
  to find some people to follow, follow who they follow, and develop
  your network.  At the same time, boost ("reblog") things that are
  good so that your network can see them.
- It's not designed for low-effort replies (quote-replies) since it
  makes engagement farming and negative attention.  You *can* reply to
  posts with the reply button on each post.  (don't forget you can
  click on post to see the thread).
- Use hashtags to make things searchable, there is no full-text search
  (to make it harder for random attacks based on opinions)
- "Fediverse" ("federated universe") is the term used to refer to the
  entire network of Mastodon servers (and more) that can communicate.
  It's not just Mastodon -
  [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) can
  communicate across different types of servers, such as image
  hosting, video, blogging, etc. - in theory avoiding lock-in.
- The Mastodon network is currently absorbing millions of new users in
  a matter of days.  Especially the popular servers can be a bit
  behind in all of the hidden network synchronization work.

We hope to see you there!
