Our next workshop, [Python for Scientific
computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/python-for-scicomp-2022/),
is ready for you!  Take part in different ways:

* If you want to learn, you can register.  Like all of our [livestream
  courses](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/),
  there are diverse ways to attend based on your needs.

* If you are a small group, attend together!  Get a meeting room, or
  online meeting, and watch together.  We will tell you when exercise
  sessions are, and then you can work together on that.

* If you are an organization, sponsor attendance locally!  Reserve a
  room, open your own registration form if you want, and host the
  watching.  There will be clear times for in-person work like this -
  if you contact us, we'll help you however much we can.

Python for Scientific Computing has run in 2020 and 2021, and was
designed to be a next step for scientists after basic Python: not too
in-depth, but showing a broad, hands-on picture of many useful tools
in the Python ecosystem.  All
[material](https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/) and
teaching is open-source before, during, and after the course.

Last year, we had 500 viewers for our peak days.  Can we make 1000 or
5000 this year? - the course certainly supports it, and with your
help, we can.

If you want to contribute more (or see how we do it), join the
[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/) chat and
introduce yourself.
