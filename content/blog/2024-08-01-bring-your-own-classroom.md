CodeRefinery, supported by the Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration (NeiC), is dedicated to enhancing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
research software development practices. Our workshops aim to provide essential training in research software development, and we’re continually exploring 
new methods to make this learning process effective and inclusive. 

**A Collaborative Effort Across Borders**

CodeRefinery hosts two workshops annually, supported by a wide network of Nordic universities and organizations. 
This collaboration helps us make Research Software Engineering (RSE) practices widely accessible and inclusive, reaching learners from varied academic backgrounds and levels.
While the current network is concentrated on the Nordics, we welcome learners, instructors and organizations from all over the world to join us.

**Open Source Learning Materials and Inclusive Workshops**

At CodeRefinery, we believe in open access to education. Our workshop materials are freely available online (https://coderefinery.org/lessons/), 
and sessions are streamed live and recorded for on-demand access on the [CodeRefinery YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47aupE7HKGduAjXKt1Gwrg). 
This supports that anyone, regardless of their location, can benefit from high-quality training.

During the workshops, we utilize a collaborative document that allows participants to interact with instructors in real-time. 
For us, the collaborative document bridges the gap between traditional in-person instruction and the virtual environment, fostering an interactive learning experience for everyone.

**Scaling with Community Support: Bring your own classroom**

An innovative aspect of CodeRefinery's approach to online workshops is the collaboration wit local partners to scale the workshop experience 
while maintaining a sense of community. Local partners organize viewing rooms, either online or in-person, where learners can gather to watch the live stream, discuss the material, and collaborate on exercises. A local team leader facilitates discussions and provides learners with support and encouragement. 

This setup not only scales the workshops to accommodate a larger number of learners but also preserves the interactive and community-centric 
atmosphere of smaller workshops. It encourages learners to learn from each other, share their experiences, and apply the skills they are 
acquiring in a supportive group environment. Through the support from a local team lead from the same organization, possibly even the same domain,
discussions can be more comfortable and targeted on learners own work. 

Local partners have the flexibility to engage in the workshop preparation and organization as much as they wish, though it is not required. 
This also means that a local partner can provide their learners with a full workshop experience, with possible tailored discussions, 
without the need for local instructors or the organizational burden of organizing a full workshop.  
We offer a one-hour onboarding session prior to the workshop to orient you on the workshop proceedings and share insights on managing a local team. 
This session also provides ample opportunity for questions and discussions. Following the workshop, we actively seek feedback from both learners 
and local hosts, including team leads. This iterative process has been invaluable in refining and enhancing the workshop experience over time.

**Many Ways to Join the Experience**

CodeRefinery’s workshops are more than just educational events — they are a step towards more open and collaborative research practices. 
You can get involved as a learner, team leader, or local partner. We welcome your participation!
