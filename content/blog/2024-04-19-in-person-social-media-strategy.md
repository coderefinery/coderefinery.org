## Introduction

We looked at our social media strategy and discussed to improve it to engage our audience and cultivate our brand presence during our in-person meeting in Troms√∏ (26 Feb-1 Mar, 2024).   

We have already documented CodeRefinery outreach and marketing plan. Link [here](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/outreach/).

## Discussion

### Why do we need a social media strategy? 

We need a good social media strategy to:

- reach wider audience
- to establisg CodeRefinery(CR) brand beyond nordic
- to build an engaged community
- let the world know about the good work we do
- expand our training network

### Our targeted audience

- Students, researchers
- Possible future CodeRefinery Teachers
- University teachers, who then steer students to us 

### Our Social media platforms

Currently we are using following platforms:

- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coderefinery-research-software-development/?viewAsMember=true)
- [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@coderefinery)
- [Twitter X](https://twitter.com/coderefine)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@coderefinery3414)
- [Zulip Chats](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com)

We paln to continue using these platforms and we decided that we don't need a complicate things by adding more platforms for our social media activities.

It seems to be possible to post in multiple some at once + schedule posts with eg.

 - https://go.loomly.com/schedule-social-media-posts/
 - https://blog.hootsuite.com/post-to-all-social-media-at-once/

### Our SMART Goals

We defined our SMART(Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant & Time-based) goals to help us to ensure that our objectives are attainable within a certain time frame.
Our SMART Goals are:

- To onboard [CodeRefinery ambassadors](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/ambassadors/)
- Frequent actions on social media (not limited to the workshops)
- Add video/visual contents to social media posts to get more visibility
- Improve outreach/publicity/webinars to various research community and encourage engagement on social media
- Tagging: Tag CodeRefinery when it is relevant, and use hashtags when posting on social media
- Promote user generated content campaigns
- Post behind the scene contents
- Boost our brand awareness
- Coordinate the timing of announcement 
- Encourage institutions to mention CodeRefinery in there posts when it is relevant.

We have our own challenges to achieve our social media strategy goals as most of us are not major social media people, but we'd like to try to be more engaging.  

Our desire is to build and expand CodeRefinery community around our shared interest in FAIR research software practices globally. It will take time to reach our desired goal, but we are optimistic and proud of our work. We can definitly achieve our desired goals wih the support of our community members/ambassadors and partner organisations.

## Epilogue

We are acting on these ideas and it looks promising as our increased visibility in social media platforms is evident.
