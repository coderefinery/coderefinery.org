March 21-23 and 28-30, 2023, we held again our [CodeRefinery online
workshop](https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/) (6 x 3.5 hours)
with 493 individual registrants and 100-200 views on average in Twitch.
Here we wish to share with the community and our future selves our lessons
learned: What worked well and what we need and plan to improve. We use bullet
point format for brevity. If you think you might have solutions for us or want
to discuss about the topic, please [reach out to
us(https://coderefinery.org/organization/contact/). This complements our
lessons learned from [our first online workshop
2020](https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/04/14/first-online-workshop/), the
[May 2021
workshop](https://coderefinery.org/blog/2021/11/25/lessons-learned-may-2021/) and the [Sep 2022 workshop](https://coderefinery.org/blog/2022/11/08/lessons-learned-Sep-2022/)

**We have identified the following main issues that we want to address for future events**:

- Some participants suggested speaking more clearly, improving mic quality, and recommending participants to get familiar with Vim, Nano, etc. before the workshop starts
- Some attendees expressed confusion with some exercises and recommended more repetition of basic commands and more concrete examples of solutions in exercises
- Some attendees suggested improving the teaching style by doing exercises while explaining each step, while others preferred doing the exercises themselves for better learning
- Suggestions for improvements, such as providing more support for online participants and having more, smaller repositories for exercises
- Some participants found certain aspects of the training confusing, such as the merging process
- Suggestion for instructors to provide clearer instructions
- Some participants wanted more hands-on exercises and more information on specific topics like environments, MATLAB, and good documentation and attribution practices.
- The participants suggested expanding the course duration or offering a series of mini workshops.
- They also suggested covering ethics and copyright law and providing solutions to exercises directly under each question.
- There are suggestions for improvement, including making the content more linear, explaining concepts in more detail, and providing more examples.
- The use of Sphinx, a documentation tool, was discussed, and some participants were unsure of its value.
- Suggestions for improvements included providing more information on common practices and beginner's mistakes, as well as offering more focused mentorship and help sessions after the course.
- Some participants felt that the daily schedule could be shorter or more compact.
- Cheat sheets or code checkpoints could be provided to help with finding information quickly.

# Summaries

### Registration

- The registration process has definitely been improved, but we have identified that it could be further streamlined.

### Workshop format

- We changed the format slightly this time around in that we removed the group Zoom rooms.
  - It was easier to organise.

### Coordination

-

### Zoom and Twitch

- Before this workshop we had decided to do away with the group Zoom rooms because it proved to be a lot of work for inconsistent results.
  - In previous workshops we found that the problems start to mount when members don't show up for the group they signed up for. As the workshop progresses, there is a drop in attendance and this affects the Zoom breakout rooms. This in and of itself is not a big problem, but we found that we get some rooms that are completely empty; some rooms are at full capacity; and some rooms have 1 or 2 people. We then have to asses each day and rearrange people together with expert helpers. This proved to be more work for little improvement in the quality of the workshop. So, we decided to do away with the group rooms for this workshop and focus only on the collaborative document.

### Collaborative notes

- As was mentioned above, we had more hands on the collaborative document since we did away with the Zoom rooms. This proved to work well because we had a lot more people answering questions, so the document was kept updated and archived for maximum performance and accuracy.

### Installation and tools

- We could have a demo exercise (or some) that people can test before the workshop
  - “If you feel comfortable with this you’re gonna be fine during the workshop”
-

### Lesson content

- We are constantly looking at improving the quality of the lessons we provide, so this is an ongoing process.
  - We take into consideration all the feedback that is given through the collaborative document to inform our decisions on where we should focus for lesson improvement.

### Communication with participants

- Add all sessions to the [CodeRefinery calendar](https://coderefinery.org/calendars/).
- Link all relevant repositories in one place (i.e. this calendar and anything that needs attention near a workshop). Make sure those repositories have good instructions in READMEs.
