The CodeRefinery community mainly lives in the Zulip chat. People are spread all over the Nordics, 
and while there is people from the same country even those can live hundreds of kilometers apart.
In order to bring the community together and develop an onboarding strategy to the community, we first need to look at what the CodeRefinery community actually is. 

The first question asked to the participants of the in-person meeting in Troms√∏ was "What is the CodeRefinery community to you?".
Answers:
- a place where it feels safe to ask questions around the coderefinery workshop, but also beyond
- a place to get some interesting tips that i didn't know i needed to know (TIL)
- RSE side that likes teaching
- A small group of people that found each other and want to make the (research)world a better place + a slightly larger group of people that find the topics more or less interesting and more or less follow what is happening
- a place to share working experience and interactions with those having similar interest 
    - i like the brainstroming discussion on varied topics
- place to get feedback and input on ideas and tasks
- place to learn things and ask for help +1
- place where there is a lot of discussions going on

The level of engagement in the community is largely tied to how much time people spend in the chat, which often is not too much. 
The main reason to engage in the chat is to ask questions and read the answers as well as coordinate CodeRefinery and other than CodeRefinery training. 
The "monday morning hello" was mentioned as one way of feeling engaged with and welcome by the community. 

Apart from "not enough time" to follow the chat, also its unorganized nature was mentioned as a reason not to engage.
This can partly be solved by using the chat differently, following/unfollowing topics that are of interest to oneself and marking topics as "resolved".
We have since been discussing a chat cleanup and reorganization/renaming strategy (to be implemented in early summer '24) and sharing tips on how to use Zulip efficiently as blog, event or video. In addition to that, admins will try to be more active in managing the chat.
After the reorganization and the addition of an eventes channel will also try to share more events of interest to the community via chat and our [calendars](https://coderefinery.org/calendars/) where appropriate. 
We already implemented a "CodeRefinery for busy people" weekly chat summary, which anyone can sign up to here:  [https://postit.csc.fi/sympa/subscribe/coderefinery-team](https://postit.csc.fi/sympa/subscribe/coderefinery-team). In addition to that, we will also continue the less frequent (~one email every one/two months) [newsletter](https://postit.csc.fi/sympa/subscribe/coderefinery).

One big ask from the community was to share the work/tasks more open and completely. We used to have a large list of tasks sorted by amount of time a community member has to spare. While this was considered a good idea, the tasks often lacked description, and so were not taken over by the community. We have therefore started to move the tasks back to the github organization, where all open tasks are assigned to repositories and described in enough detail that anyone in the community could pick up the task. The tasks are also labelled by the time it approximately takes to fulfill the task and urgency. You can find the board under the Coderefinery GitHub organization under Projects.

In addition community calls were mentioned. We will have some more in the future and try to have them also more regularly. These community calls can have a specific topic and/or serve as Q&A and discussion sessions for the community. We also invite the community to shape these calls, by suggesting topics or take over the organization of a call. In order to attract people to the community calls, the topics and dates should be set as early as possible.

We also brainstormed ideas for attracting more people to be instructors/helpers/organizers of the CodeRefinery workshop. Since we upscaled the workshop from ~20 people in person workshop to ~200 online participants, things have gotten more complex. It is less engaging to teach to the stream. Our co-teaching model ensures that the instructor is never alone and the collaborative document is used to influence the teaching, but that does not replace a room full of learners. The current workshop format also seems very complex for newcomers and we have not been offering a train-the-trainer program lately (planned for fall 2024 now! - stay tuned). Due to the sometimes a little bit chaotic planning phase and usually enough team members signing up for the workshop we have not done much active outreach. For this to work it might be required to contact possible instructors more directly and offer f2f mentoring. We should also make sure to not misuse our dear volunteers by not overburdening and burning them out. There needs to be something to get in return. 

In order to engage with the community a few other ideas were discussed as well: 
We could approach different domain communities by visiting their events and presenting CodeRefinery. In addition, we could organize our own info events, targeting different groups to engage more directly. Here, also our close connection to the RSE community could be used more. Another idea was to offer further BYOC (bring your own code) sessions to provide the possibility of interacting with CodeRefinery instructors and asking for support.
