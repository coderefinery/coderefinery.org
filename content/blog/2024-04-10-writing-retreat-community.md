The CodeRefinery community mainly lives in the Zulip chat. People are spread all over the Nordics, 
and while there is people from the same country even those can live hundreds of kilometers apart.
In order to bring the community together and develop an onboarding strategy to the community, we first need to look at what the CodeRefinery community actually is. 

The first question asked to the participants of the in-person meeting in TromsÃ¸ was "What is the CodeRefinery community to you?".
Answers:
- a place where it feels safe to ask questions around the coderefinery workshop, but also beyond
- a place to get some interesting tips that i didn't know i needed to know (TIL)
- RSE side that likes teaching
- A small group of people that found each other and want to make the (research)world a better place + a slightly larger group of people that find the topics more or less interesting and more or less follow what is happening
- a place to share working experience and interactions with those having similar interest 
    - i like the brainstroming discussion on varied topics
- place to get feedback and input on ideas and tasks
- place to learn things and ask for help +1
- place where there is a lot of discussions going on

The level of engagement in the community is largely tied to how much time people spend in the chat, which often is not too much. 
The main reason to engage in the chat is to ask questions and read the answers as well as coordinate CodeRefinery and other than CodeRefinery training. 
The "monday morning hello" was mentioned as one way of feeling engaged with and welcome by the community. 

Apart from "not enough time" to follow the chat, also its unorganized nature was mentioned as a reason not to engage.
This can partly be solved by using the chat differently, following/unfollowing topics that are of interest to oneself and marking topics as "resolved".

Improvement suggestions for the CodeRefinery community: 
- More event news sharing
- Community calls
- Newsletters
- Adjust default channels for new members and update their descriptions
- Dedicated admins
- More work sharing

We also collected some feedback on how we could activate more helpers and instructors for our workshops; answers:
- stream format and site of the workshop
- no train the trainer training offered lately+4
- What we have now has worked so far: thus we don't ask around enough for more people as much as we could.
- Simplify workshop complexity
- Ask peopel directly "do you want to be an instructor?  I'll mentor you."
- when organising the training event, directly ask who will get onboard to be instructors for xxx session.
    - when close to the workshop, ask who will be active helpers for specific sessions (if you ask me about this 3 months before the workshop, it is difficult for me to decide as i may have other activities that I have to be there).
- What do I get in return ?

Community engagement suggestions:
- community calls
  - They were not so popular were they?
  - Could it be a zoom/chat session?
- clear calls for "please do this" (not just teaching)
  - Maybe the GH board would function as such?
- recognizing different levels
  - levels of what?
- Telling people what to do?  Can be hard to step up but maybe people want to do more but don't know what, someone specifically asking you helps.
- microtasking
- regular Q/A sessions to provide support

Community call suggestions: 
- topical +1
- engagement possibility
  - I think this is not enough as such -> a random person needs a reason to engage with someone. What would these reasons be? A need of help at least.
- anyone new that comes can leave with something to do (if they want)
- interesting topics to learn from and not a place to get more tasks to do
- user stories
- sharing experiences about conference/meeting, and other onsite/online activities that are relevant to CodeRefinery trainings
- They also need to know about all the good possibilities beforehand

Other thoughts on community: 
## Any other thought about communities you may have 

- BYOC (bring your own code) sessions could be made a thing? -> "coderefinery garage"
- Connection to RSE can bring people on
- networking with research community ->sessions where we address a particular research community
- presence in events and event organize own events
