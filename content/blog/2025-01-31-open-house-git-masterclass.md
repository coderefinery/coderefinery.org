# Open house session on advanced git curriculum


On January 14, 2025, we held an Open House session was to discuss the need to develop an
intermediate to advanced Git curriculum, sometimes also referred to as a "Git masterclass".
We invited educators and practitioners from various institutions and communities to share resources,
identify curriculum gaps, and start strategizing on lesson development. 

We reached out to the community during different events, in several RSE chats (including the CodeRefinery Zulip chat)
and via CodeRefinery social media accounts with a variation of this text: 

```
Are you teaching Git?

Come to our Open House session on Tuesday Jan 14 and discuss with few people who
are interested in how a lesson could look like which goes beyond basic Git.

Let's share materials, find the gaps in the curriculums and collaborate to fill these gaps. 

Connection details and agenda: XXX

## Session Overview:

- **Participants**: The session included representatives from organizations such as the University of Tromsø (NO),
Met Office (UK), CSC-IT Center for Science (FI), the University of Sheffield (UK), RWTH Aachen University (DE),
the University of Jena (DE), UPPMAX (SE), the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (DE), Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut (DK),
Karlsruher Institute für Technologie (DE), UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Aalto University (FI), Newcastle University (UK)
and Heidelberg University (DE).

- **Objectives**: The primary goals were to exchange teaching materials, discuss experiences in instructing Git, 
and collaboratively think about a curriculum that addresses advanced Git topics beyond the basics.

## Key Activities:

- **Introductions:** Participants introduced themselves, detailing their affiliations, experiences with Git, 
teaching backgrounds, and objectives for the session.

- **Resource Sharing:** Attendees shared links to existing materials and compiled a list of advanced Git topics 
to be covered in the curriculum. See next upcoming blogpost (Feb'25) for more details.

- **Experience Exchange:** Small group discussions facilitated the sharing of teaching experiences, challenges faced,
and effective strategies for conveying complex Git concepts.

- **Keyword Collection:** The group identified key topics and discussed their relevance within the proposed curriculum.

- **Breakout Sessions:** Participants divided into groups focusing on specific themes such as:
        - Recovery
        - History
        - User Interfaces
        - Project Organization
        - Collaborative Workflows

- **Gap Identification:** We concluded the session with a discussion aimed at identifying gaps in existing materials
and planning future collaborative efforts to develop comprehensive lessons.

## Outcomes and Insights:

- **Resource Compilation:** A diverse array of teaching materials and resources were shared, providing 
a solid foundation for the curriculum development.

- **Community Building:** The session fostered a sense of community among Git educators, 
highlighting the value of collaboration in enhancing teaching methodologies.

- **Future Collaboration:** Participants expressed interest in ongoing collaboration to 
refine and expand the advanced Git curriculum.

## Personal Reflections:

Engaging with fellow educators and practitioners provided valuable insights into 
the diverse approaches to teaching Git. The collaborative nature of the session underscored 
the importance of sharing knowledge and resources to improve educational outcomes.

## Conclusion:

The Open House session in January 2025, marked a significant step toward developing a comprehensive 
intermediate to advanced Git curriculum. The collective expertise and willingness to collaborate 
among participants set a strong foundation for future efforts in this area. We will soon also 
share the outcomes and materials in more detail. Stay tuned!

## Call to Action:

We encourage all educators and practitioners interested in contributing to the development of 
the advanced Git curriculum to join future sessions and collaborate in this ongoing initiative.
