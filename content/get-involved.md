CodeRefinery consists of two parts: an **open source project** producing lesson
material openly, and a **publically funded Nordic project** to give these
workshops in the Nordics.  Anyone may join the open source project as equal
partners to the Nordic project.

CodeRefinery is always looking for both people and institutions that can
promote the FAIRness of software managemeng and development practice. There are
many ways that you can get involved.  You can check out our
[manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/), in particular the [about
us](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/the-project/) and
[contributing](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/contributing/) pages, for
more about us.

We are in the same galaxy as the [Carpentries
organization](https://carpentries.org/) and closely work with them. We run our
workshops in a slightly different way, but our general philosophy, lesson
material, and procedures are interchangeable. Our lessons should be considered
Carpentries lessons.


### Become a workshop helper

Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but
would like to attend another one to refresh your memory and share your own
knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background in research software
engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly
environment? Join a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop as a helper! [Get in
touch](/get-involved/#contact-us) and let us know which workshop you would like
to join. For more information about what a helper is supposed to do, please
refer [Helper’s
guide](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/helping-and-teaching/)


### Host a workshop

If you are in the Nordics, you can invite us to give a workshop.  If
not, let us know anyway but you can also teach this material yourself.
If you need some structure for the workshops, we suggest that they are
given under the [Carpentries organization
framework](https://carpentries.org/) for workshops, but the format is
up to you as long as you distinguish between your workshop and the
funded "CodeRefinery" project.

For more information about organizing a workshop, please refer to
[CodeRefinery workshop administration
guide](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/workshop-administration/),
or [Carpentries workshop organization
information](https://carpentries.org/workshops/).


### Become an instructor

We suggest that most instructors start with [Carpentries instructor
training](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/).  We have [instructor
training](https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/), but
this mostly serves as a compliment focused on our lessons and more
intermediate users.

CodeRefinery (via [NeIC](https://neic.no/training)), reserves 15 seats
per year for Carpentries instructor training. Please [get in
touch](mailto:support@coderefinery.org) for more information if this
sounds interesting.

After taking either instructor training, you are welcome to
self-organize a Carpentries workshop or join a workshop as an
instructor when instructors are recruited via #workshop stream of
[CodeRefinery Zulip
chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/).

With that being said, there are no strict requirements to working with
us and learning "on the job": we help people organically grow from
learner → helper → instructor.  So far, the best way to get involved is to
join our chat and let us know when you see something you are
interested in.


### Contribute to teaching material

All our [lessons](/lessons/) are [on GitHub](https://github.com/coderefinery). Contributions
to the lesson material are highly welcome! The best way to contribute is via
the forking-pull request workflow. See our lesson on [collaborative version
control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/02-distributed/) for
an overview of how this works. You can also [contact us](/get-involved/#contact-us) via other
channels.


### Reuse our material

We very much encourage reusing our lessons and contributing changes:

### Become an institutional partner as a training hub

Coderefinery started as a sponsored and funded project, but we are
encouraging more partnerships to stay sustainable long-term.  In
general, we image a reciprocal relationship for academic institutions:
you help us run workshops, we give workshops at your institution.

Please take a look at [training hubs
page](https://coderefinery.org/about/hubs/) for more information.
