CodeRefinery is organizing a one day online "open house" dedicated to
work together on revising and
improving [our instructor training
material](https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/).
[Issues are filed
here](https://github.com/coderefinery/instructor-training/issues),
notes from the first workshop can be in the [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/@doFoQYKqR623RI-YyXvmew/HJGgb_9VL), and we
are taking what each of us wants to work on. Input for the further
improvement are also very welcome.

Anyone who would like to contribute to the instructor training
material, or learn how to contribute to any CodeRefinery lesson in
general, is welcome!

We will collect nodes in a [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/@doFoQYKqR623RI-YyXvmew/HJGgb_9VL).
Please note that this document will be archived in our [Open House
event repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/open-house).

We first meet online at 9:00 am (UTC+1) via video (connection link
will be shared in our [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/@doFoQYKqR623RI-YyXvmew/HJGgb_9VL) and
then work on the instructor training material. During the day, we will
coordinate the work through our [Zulip
chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) with possibilities to
further discuss via video if necessary.

We conclude the day around 4:00 pm (UTC+1) by writing a short
blog/summary in our [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/@doFoQYKqR623RI-YyXvmew/HJGgb_9VL).
