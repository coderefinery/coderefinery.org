CodeRefinery is organizing a one day online "open house" dedicated to
collaboratively writing up blog posts which have been in 
the pipeline for some time and which will be published in the next 
CodeRefinery newsletter.

Tentative list of articles:
- Future mega-CR 
- Update on citable lessons and credit/visibility for instructor and helpers
- Update on sustainability efforts?
- Manuals : how they can be used for your lessons 
- git-pr

Anyone who would like to contribute to these articles or suggests new
topics is welcome to join!

We will collect notes in a [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/2020-08-24-openhouse).
Please note that this document will be archived in our [Open House
event repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/open-house).

We first meet online at 9:00 am (CEST) / 10:00 am (EEST) via video (connection link

the instructor training material. During the day, we will coordinate
the work through our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com)
with possibilities to further discuss via video if necessary.

We conclude the day around 4:00 pm (UTC+1) by writing a short
