### Welcome to the first CodeRefinery Open House!

The idea behind this event is to bring together people who are interesting in
contributing to the [CodeRefinery training
material](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/).

Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the
CodeRefinery training material is very welcome to join.

We will collect nodes in a [shared document](https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA).
Please note that this document will be archived in our
[Open House event repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/open-house).

We first meet online at 9:00 am (UTC+1) via video (connection link will be
shared in our [shared document](https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA)) and
then work on CodeRefinery training material. During the day, we will coordinate
the work through our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) with
possibilities to further discuss via video if necessary.

We conclude the day around 4:00pm (UTC+1) by writing a short blog/summary in
our [shared document](https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA).
