### Welcome to the second CodeRefinery Open House!

Following up on our successful first CodeRefinery Open House, we will have our
second online Open house!

The idea behind this event is to work together on revising and improving
[coderefinery.org](https://coderefinery.org). [Issues are
filed](https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/issues) and we are
taking what each of us wants to work on. Input for the further improvement are
very welcome!

Anyone who would like to contribute, or learn how to contribute to
[coderefinery.org](https://coderefinery.org) is very welcome to join.

We will collect nodes in a [shared document](https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA).
Please note that this document will be archived in our
[Open House event repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/open-house).

We first meet online at 9:00 am (UTC+1) via video (connection link will be
shared in our [shared document](https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA)) and
then work on CodeRefinery training material. During the day, we will coordinate
the work through our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) with
possibilities to further discuss via video if necessary.

We conclude the day around 4:00pm (UTC+1) by writing a short blog/summary in
our [shared document](https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA).
