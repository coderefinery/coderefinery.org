# Training and e-Infrastructure for Research Software Development

We teach all the **essential tools** which are usually skipped in academic
education so everyone can make full use of software, computing, and
data. We don't just give courses, but **we are a training network** that you
can join to share the effort and bring better courses to your
community.

Our [standard workshop](@/lessons/core.md) is well known in Nordic
academic circles and our [our engaging online teaching
style](@/workshops/teaching-style.md) is considered best-in-class even
compared to in-person teaching.  CodeRefinery aims to operate as a
community project with support from academic organizations.
