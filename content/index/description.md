# We train you in research software development

Are you an academic researcher using computing/data, and your work is
held back by struggling with the programming or data management?  Or
your research isn't reproducible or open enough?  CodeRefinery
understands and has free online courses and materials for you.

We teach all the **essential tools** which are usually skipped in academic
education so everyone can make full use of software, computing, and
data with focus on reusability, reproducibility, and openness. 
We don't just give courses, but **we are a training network** that you
can join to share the effort and bring better courses to your
community.

Our [standard workshop](@/lessons/core.md) is well known in Nordic
academic circles and our [engaging online teaching
style](@/workshops/teaching-style.md) is considered best-in-class even
compared to in-person teaching.  CodeRefinery is publicly funded and
operates as a community project.
