## CodeRefinery provides

* For **organizations**: an opportunity to pool competence
  and offer more training and development opportunities than
  they could individually.  A place to share best teaching practices
  and other skills.
* For **volunteers** and the team: a community around teaching
  and opportunity for skill development, both in pedagogy and
  practical skills.
* For **learners**: a welcoming and useful environment for
  learning many necessary practical skills that may otherwise
  not be explicitly taught. This can be through courses,
  hackathons, and the like.
