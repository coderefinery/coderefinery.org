## Video recordings

A number of video recordings of CodeRefinery lessons and workshops and
[Research Software Hour](https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/) sessions can be
found on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47aupE7HKGduAjXKt1Gwrg/videos).


### Other lessons by our partners and the CodeRefinery community

You can expect these to be open-source, reusable, in a git repository, and with
a community you can join and give contributions to:

- [Python for Scientific
  Computing](https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/), by
  Aalto Scientific Computing, UiO, UiT, KTH.  Not a basic Python
  course, but taking your from basic programming to the tools needed
  for scientific computing.
- [Linux shell
  tutorial](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/linux-shell-tutorial/).
  By Aalto Scientific Computing, level: intermediate, covers basics
  but focus on scripting.
- [Introduction to MPI](https://rantahar.github.io/introduction-to-mpi/)
- [Introduction to MPI](https://pdc-support.github.io/introduction-to-mpi/): Derived from the above.
- [Intermediate MPI](https://enccs.github.io/intermediate-mpi/)
- [Introduction to High-Performance Computing](https://sabryr.github.io/hpc-intro/)


### Teach our lessons

All of our material is open source and collaboratively developed: you
are free to teach it yourself if you would like, just make sure the
distinction between the funded "CodeRefinery" project and your
workshop is clear.  Our lessons are designed to be generic, so that
anyone can use them.  If that isn't the case, help us make them so
(see below).  Be aware that our lessons are developed in a very agile
manner, so keep up to date with the latest changes.

See how to [get involved](/get-involved/) for more information, and
please let us know if the material is helpful - it is important for us
to know whether this material has impact outside of our workshops.


### Contribute to our lessons

We would love that!  We are a normal open source project on Github,
and you can contribute via issues, pull requests, or discussing via
our [chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/).  Our
[collaborative Git
lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/) and [Github
without the command
line](https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/) are
very relevant.

If you are familiar with the Carpentries organization, we work
basically the same.  If you have more questions or are unsure how to
contribute, please [get in touch](/get-involved/#contact-us) or see
our [our information on
contributing](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/contributing/).
