title = "Contributing to our lessons"

We would love that!  We are a normal open source project on Github, and you
can contribute via issues, pull requests, or discussing via our
[chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/).

A good starting point is to either open a topic on our
[chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) or to open an issue on one of the
lesson repositories where you can describe what you would like to change to
collect feedback and possibly also contributors.
