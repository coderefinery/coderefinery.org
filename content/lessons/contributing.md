We would love to see more contributions to our lessons. We are a normal open
source project on GitHub, and you can contribute via issues, pull requests, or
discussing via our [chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/).

A good starting point is to either open a topic on our
[chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) or to open an issue on one of the
lesson repositories in our [GitHub
organization](https://github.com/coderefinery) where you can describe what you
would like to change to collect feedback and possibly also contributors.

No contribution is too small and ideas for changes are very often very good
ideas and we would love to work with you on making our lessons better and more
modular and even more relevant.
