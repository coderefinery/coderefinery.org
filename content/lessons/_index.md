### Other lessons by our partners and the CodeRefinery community

You can expect these to be open-source, reusable, in a git repository, and with
a community you can join and give contributions to:

- [Python for Scientific
  Computing](https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/), by
  Aalto Scientific Computing, UiO, UiT, KTH.  Not a basic Python
  course, but taking your from basic programming to the tools needed
  for scientific computing.
- [Linux shell
  tutorial](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/linux-shell-tutorial/).
  By Aalto Scientific Computing, level: intermediate, covers basics
  but focus on scripting.
- [Introduction to MPI](https://rantahar.github.io/introduction-to-mpi/)
- [Introduction to MPI](https://pdc-support.github.io/introduction-to-mpi/): Derived from the above.
