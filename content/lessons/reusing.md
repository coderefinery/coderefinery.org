title = "Reusing/teaching our lessons"
+++

All of our material is open source and collaboratively developed: you are free
to teach it yourself if you would like, just make sure the distinction between
the "CodeRefinery" project and your workshop is clear.

Our lessons are designed to be generic, so that anyone can use them.  If that
isn't the case, please help us make them so.  Be aware that our lessons are
developed in a very agile manner, so keep up to date with the latest changes.

**Please let us know if the material is helpful** - it is important for us to
know whether this material has impact outside of our workshops. Some
courses/workshops we know of are listed below but we would like to list more.
