All of our material is open source and reuse is encouraged.  In
general, we only recommend similarly open-source, reusable lessons.
Check the license from each repository in case of questions (most
CodeRefinery-developed lessons use [CC BY
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).

Our core lessons can also be cited and linked to via DOI (published in our [Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/coderefinery) :

Teaching these lessons independently is encouraged, just make sure the
distinction between the "CodeRefinery" project and your workshop is
clear.  For example, give your own name to the workshop but say
"(CodeRefinery lessons)".

**Our lessons are designed to be generic, (mostly) stand-alone, and
re-used in place without forking** so that anyone can use them and
they can fit into different types of programs.  We welcome
contributions which make the lessons more reusable - send changes
using standard open-source practices (you know, what we teach in
CodeRefinery and all).

**Please let us know if the material is helpful** - it is important for us to
know whether this material has impact outside of our workshops. Some
courses/workshops we know of are listed below but we would like to list more.

You can also find some of our lessons and other materials in our 
[Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/coderefinery).


## Derivative work based on our material

- [How to parallelize independent tasks](https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/independent-jobs-in-parallel/) taught online
  as part of [NRIS/Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/) training.
  It reuses part of [Tuesdays tools and techniques for HPC: Real-life compute cluster workflows](https://coderefinery.github.io/TTT4HPC_resource_management/).
- Some talks in the [software and data seminar](https://wias-berlin.de/seminars/swdata/) at the Weierstrass-Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin, Germany.
- [Collaborating and sharing using GitHub without command
  line](https://miketrizna.github.io/github-without-command-line/)
  taught as part of a Carpentries workshop at the Smithsonian and now
  part of the [Carpentries
  Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals/issues/166).
  This lesson is based on [this lesson
  material](https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/).
- [Digital skills workshops](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/digital-skills/) at
  the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). These
  workshops use Documentation, Testing, and Modular code modules. The most
  recent edition was [Good Practices in Research Software Development
  (CodeRefinery) in June 2023](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/2023-06-19-ds-cr/).
- Short versions as 10-15 min presentations of [reproducible
  research](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8089472)  and
  [documentation](https://github.com/samumantha/documentation_example) lesson
  at "Best practice guide for software developers and scientists in Extremes DT
  and Climate DT" workshop in June 2023.
- Tools for Scientific Software Development and Data Science (2020) in Aalborg.
- [Using Git to Code, Collaborate and Share](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/grad_school_git_course/) by Imperial College London.
