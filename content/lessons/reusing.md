title = "Reusing/teaching our lessons"
+++

All of our material is open source and reuse is encouraged.  In
general, we only recommend similarly open-source, reusable lessons.
Check the license from each repository in case of questions (most
CodeRefinery-developed lessons use [CC BY
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Teaching these lessons independently is encouraged, just make sure the
distinction between the "CodeRefinery" project and your workshop is
clear.  For example, give your own name to the workshop but say
"(CodeRefinery lessons)".

**Our lessons are designed to be generic, (mostly) stand-alone, and
re-used in place without forking** so that anyone can use them and
they can fit into different types of programs.  We welcome
contributions which make the lessons more reusable - send changes
using standard open-source practices (you know, what we teach in
CodeRefinery and all).

**Please let us know if the material is helpful** - it is important for us to
know whether this material has impact outside of our workshops. Some
courses/workshops we know of are listed below but we would like to list more.
