## Other lessons by our partners

You can expect these to be open-source, reusable, in a git repository, and with
a community you can join and give contributions to:

- [Python for Scientific
  Computing](https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/), by
  Aalto Scientific Computing, UiO, UiT, KTH.  Not a basic Python
  course, but taking your from basic programming to the tools needed
  for scientific computing.

- [Linux shell
  tutorial](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/linux-shell-tutorial/)
  or the shorter [Shell crash
  course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/).  By Aalto
  Scientific Computing, level: intermediate, covers basics but focus
  on scripting.

- [Introduction to MPI](https://rantahar.github.io/introduction-to-mpi/):
  Gives an introduction to MPI using a Carpentries lesson template.

- [Introduction to MPI](https://pdc-support.github.io/introduction-to-mpi/):
  Derived from the above and taught at the PDC Center for High Performance
  Computing at KTH, Stockholm.

- [Intermediate MPI](https://enccs.github.io/intermediate-mpi/):
  ENCCS course material that can be a good step after going through MPI introduction (above).


## Lessons we contributed to as instructors or helpers

- [Introduction to Conda for (Data) Scientists](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/):
  Gives a good overview of how Conda works and how to use it.


## Other lessons we recommend

- [Existing Research Software Engineering Training Material by INTERSECT](https://intersect-training.org/training-links/):
  This is the currently best commented overview of available lessons around research
  software engineering that we know of.

- [Intermediate Research Software Development in Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/)
  This is a great resource for somebody who wants to go beyond the introductory
  Carpentries lesson about Python.

- [Introduction to High-Performance Computing](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/):
  Introduction to UNIX shell, file transfer, and how to submit and manage calculations on a cluster.

- [ENCCS instructor training](https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/):
  This ENCCS instructor training material is focused on helping competent
  practitioners and experts teach their knowledge to others. It also serves a
  kickstart to teaching ENCCS lessons.
