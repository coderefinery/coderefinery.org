These are the lessons which are included in the "standard"
CodeRefinery workshop, and what we believe that every computational
scientist (even those with very small amounts of computation) should
know.

- [Introduction to version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/)
- [Collaborative distributed version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)
- [Documentation](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/)
- [Jupyter notebooks](https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/)
- [Automated testing](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/)
- [Social coding and open software](https://coderefinery.github.io/social-coding/)
- [Reproducible research](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/)
- [Modular code development type-along](https://coderefinery.github.io/modular-type-along/)


## Self-study workshop

Want to study this material yourself?  No problem!  The CodeRefinery
teaching style tries to make this accessible to you.  All the
lessons above are designed to be self-sufficient for self-study.  We
also have video recordings and archived "parallel chat Q&A" (which can
go into other both basic and advanced questions) which may
optionally be useful for other teaching styles.

The following are the video recordings + parallel chat of the 2022
September workshop:

* The lesson material is linked above, and is probably more up-to-date
  than the chat/playlist below.
* [Parallel chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/questions/)
* [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJACqaFsfQiCWp0Wqy6qG4iau)

For self-study purposes, you may need the [installation
instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).  Note
that you may want to see what is necessary for each lesson, before
going and installing everything there.

**Support in self-study** is very important.  There are several
options:
* Most of the tools in these lessons are pretty standard.  Ask your
  friends and colleagues for help - you will probably both learn
  something.
* You may get local support from our partner organizations. We will share a
  link after we have reorganized the pages.
* There is a #help stream in [CodeRefinery
  chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) where we welcome
  general questions and provide support on a best-effort basis.
