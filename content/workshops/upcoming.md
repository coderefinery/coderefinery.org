### Requesting workshop

If you are interested in hosting a workshop or co-organizing a workshop with
us, please [contact us](/organization/contact/). It is good for us if we get
asked for workshops as this makes it easier for us to show that there is demand
and to motivate funding. We will then take it from there and discuss how we can
make it happen. The more we are to collaborate, the easier it will be.
