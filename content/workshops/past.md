# Past workshops and events

This page lists the [standard core CodeRefinery
workshop](@/lessons/core.md) as well as other teaching events by the
CodeRefinery team. Before March 2020, we focused on small/medium
in-person workshops at sites around the Nordics.  After that, we
focused on online teaching, and by the time in-person restrictions
were over, the [CodeRefinery teaching styl](TODO-LINK) was so well
developed that we are continuing online with in-person workshops as
requested.
