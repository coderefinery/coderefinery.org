## Join an existing workshop

Requesting a workshop is so 2019, isn't it?  At least for us it is.
As of 2022, most of our workshops are online.  This isn't just because
of Covid-19 still, but we have found that online innovations such as
co-teaching, HackMD, livestreaming, and more contributors allows us to
deliver a better quality program (and that's even before we get to the
broader audience).  Various institutions run in-person breakout rooms
and exercise sessions for the courses, too.

So, our most common recommendation for the classic 3-day CodeRefinery
workshops is to join one of the online courses with your own
registration and local breakout rooms (in-person or online).  The most
important part of our current model is teams with exercise leaders,
and this model allows anyone to join as long as they can find these
local leaders.



## Private workshops requests

If you would like to request a private workshop, please get in touch.
As of 2022, with our updated funding situation, CodeRefinery is more
of a decentralized organization and we don't have dedicated staff to
offer workshops (note: before 2022 this was mainly in the Nordic
countries).  Thus,

- You'd be expected to help with the teaching and organization some,
  or
- Or one of our partner organizations might be able to put on a
  workshop for you.

During this transition period, it's best to join the [CodeRefniery
chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) and discuss there - we are
re-inventing as we speak.  It's good to ask if you are interested,
even if we can't do it yet - this shows demand and helps with future
funding!

Since CodeRefinery still has Nordic roots, that is our main audience.
Workshops have been requested by both organizations and individual
research groups.  Price might be free (e.g. a staff member at a
national computing center can provide the workshop) or some other
CodeRefinery partner might be able to name a price.



## Other workshops

CodeRefinery is now more than one workshop curriculum, but a platform
for sharing a wide variety of workshops.  These are more ad-hoc based
on interest from partners.  Many of them can be joined as described in
the first section of this page.

These workshops have ranged as broadly as "HPC Kickstart" to "Python
for Scientific Computing".
