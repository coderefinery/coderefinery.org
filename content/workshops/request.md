## Join an existing workshop

Requesting a workshop is so 2019, isn't it?  At least for us it is.
As of 2022, most of our workshops are online and anyone may join, no
matter where you are.  This isn't just because
of Covid-19, but we have found that our [teaching
style](@/workshops/teaching-style.md) provides such a high-quality
program that few people show up in-person when there is that
opportunity.  [Join as a partner](@/join/organizations.md) and you
can provide in-person exercise sessions and support to your local
audience.



## Run your own workshop

You are welcome to re-use our materials for your own workshops.
Please don't call it a "CodeRefinery" workshop, but you can say it
uses CodeRefinery materials. (e.g. call it "Software development for
researchers (CodeRefinery)").  The policy of our name usage may change
later.



## Local / custom workshops requests

If you would like to request a private workshop, [please get in
touch](@/about/contact.md).  As of 2022, with our updated funding
situation, CodeRefinery is more of a decentralized organization and we
may not have dedicated staff to offer workshops.
Thus, you would be expected to help with the teaching and organization some.

During this transition period, it's best to join the [CodeRefniery
chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) and discuss there - we are
re-inventing as we speak.  It's good to ask if you are interested,
even if we can't do it yet - this shows demand and helps with future
funding!

Since CodeRefinery still has Nordic roots, that is our main audience.
Workshops have been requested by both organizations and individual
research groups.  Price might be free (e.g. a staff member at a
national computing center can provide the workshop) or some other
CodeRefinery partner might be able to name a price.
