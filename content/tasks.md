# Tasks and roadmap

This page exists to make it easier to help and easier to see what project
members are working on and what tasks they prioritize.

We wanted to move this from our heads and from our notebooks and make this
visible and accessible for everybody who wants to help and be involved.

If somebody has 1 hour
time per week or month and would like to help out, it should be easy to **find
a meaningful task** and to get the **necessary context and contact**. Bigger
tasks are too big for volunteers but we still find it useful to communicate
what we work on or would like to work on if we had more time, so that volunteer
individuals and organizations can stay informed.

## Good first issues if you have 1 hour

- Browse <https://coderefinery.org/> and [open
  issues](https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/issues) about
  problems you find or any suggestions for improvements.

- Take a [website issue](https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/issues) which looks
  interesting and easy to you. Ask on chat or mention `@bast` if you want more context about any of these.

- Browse any of the [core lessons](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/core/) and
  open issues with suggestions for improvement.

- Test our [install instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/)
  and give us [feedback](https://github.com/coderefinery/installation/issues).


## Issues which are easy for somebody with a bit of overview

- Go through TO-DO items from [the 2022 kick-off
  event](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/kickoff2022) and port them to this
  document.

- Add a web page on <https://coderefinery.org/> crediting staff/team.

- On <https://coderefinery.org/> describe better how somebody or some
  organization can help. This page here is part
  of the solution but more is needed.

- In the [manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/) add a new page that
  explains certificates and evaluation process.

- Take a [manual issue](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/issues) which
  looks interesting and easy to you. Ask on chat or mention `@bast` if you want
  more context about any of these.

- List on <https://coderefinery.org/join/individuals/> the steps that need to
  be done by a new person.

- Set up a Zenodo community.


## Tasks where we struggle and can use help

- Outreach, newsletter, social media. You can help us with blogs, drafting
  newsletter, engaging in relevant social media posts.

- Create a governance charter for a non-profit organization which could be the
  follow-up organization for CodeRefinery.

- Event management. We have many folks who like to develop lessons or teach or
  help but who do not
  enjoy the event management part of it. But perhaps you do? You could help
  us reaching many more people.

## If you have 1 day

- Take an [issue](https://github.com/coderefinery/installation/issues) from
  our [install instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).

- Teaser slide deck (5 slides?) which explains what the project is about and
  how organizations can get on board.

- Short video which explains how to join a workshop.

- Set up a registration page for September 2023 workshop. RB is working on it but can
  use additional feedback and help.
  Start from <https://coderefinery.org/blog/2023/06/25/planning-sep-workshop/>.

- Take a lesson issue which looks
  interesting and easy to you from one of our
  [lessons](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/from-coderefinery/). Ask on chat
  or mention `@bast` if you want more context about any of these.

- Make one of our lessons citable starting from
  <https://coderefinery.org/blog/2021/11/21/towards-citable-lessons/>. Use a
  `CITATION.cff` file and from that one generate the `.zenodo.json` file and
  deploy to Zenodo. Document how to do this for all other lessons. Contact JH
  or RB if you want to join this task.

- Create a commented list of our lessons starting from
  <https://coderefinery.org/lessons/from-coderefinery/>.
  The comments could be: audience, maturity, strong points, weaker points,
  etc.

  community. Instead of only linking to other material, add comments.
