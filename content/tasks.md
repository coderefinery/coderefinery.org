# Tasks and roadmap

This page exists to make it easier to help and easier to see what project
members are working on and what tasks they prioritize.

We wanted to move this from our heads and from our notebooks and make this
visible and accessible for everybody who wants to help and be involved.

If somebody has 1 hour
time per week or month and would like to help out, it should be easy to **find
a meaningful task** and to get the **necessary context and contact**. Bigger
tasks are too big for volunteers but we still find it useful to communicate
what we work on or would like to work on if we had more time, so that volunteer
individuals and organizations can stay informed.

</div>

In each category we try to sort tasks by priority from most urgent to least
urgent.
