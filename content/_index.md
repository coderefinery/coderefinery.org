## Training and e-Infrastructure for Research Software Development

We teach all the essential tools which are usually skipped in academic
education so everyone can make full use of software, computing, and
data. We don't just give courses , but are a training network that you
can join to share the effort and bring better courses to your
community.

Our [standard workshop](@/lessons/core.md) is well known in Nordic
academic circles and our [our engaging online teaching
style](@/workshops/teaching-style.md) is considered best-in-class even
compared to in-person teaching.  CodeRefinery aims to operate as a
community project with support from academic organizations.

### CodeRefinery provides
* For **organizations**: an opportunity to pool competence
  and offer more training and development opportunities than
  they could individually.  A place to share best teaching practices
  and other skills.
* For **volunteers** and the team: a community around teaching
  and opportunity for skill development, both in pedagogy and
  practical skills.
* For **learners**: a welcoming and useful environment for
  learning many necessary practical skills that may otherwise
  not be explicitly taught. This can be through courses,
  hackathons, and the like.
