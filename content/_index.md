## Training and e-Infrastructure for Research Software Development

CodeRefinery acts as a hub for FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable) software practices. It currently
focuses on the Nordic/Baltic countries, but aims to expand
beyond this region. CodeRefinery aims to operate as a
community project with support from academic organizations.

it](https://hackmd.io/KRqQirJ_Rn2SHcE-t1iAUg?view)).

### CodeRefinery provides
* For **organizations**: an opportunity to pool competence
  and offer more training and development opportunities than
  they could individually.
* For **volunteers** and the team: a community around teaching
  and opportunity for skill development, both in pedagogy and
  practical skills.
* For **learners**: a welcoming and useful environment for
  learning many necessary practical skills that may otherwise
  not be explicitly taught. This can be through courses,
  hackathons, and the like.
