## Our teaching philosophies

On [this page](https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/02-teaching-philosophies/)
our instructors share their teaching philosophies in short recorded videos.


## Who's the team?

The team consists of volunteers, usually paid as part of their work, and
CodeRefinery staff paid by NeIC. If you are an instructor for two workshops or
otherwise consistently contribute to material or CodeRefinery organization, and
occasionally come to our online meetings, please request to be added to the
list above. Likewise, we remove people after they are inactive for a year.

CodeRefinery is evolving to a collaborative project - join us!
