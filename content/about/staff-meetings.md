## Decisions

Decisions made in the meeting should be listed with the item-number.  

>Ex.
>- 2021-MM-DD: An example decision in one-two sentences >and possibly link to more context, (related item->number).

- 2021-07-05: Pre-/post-workshop survey will be processed for the talk on the 30th Aug at RDA Nordic and for the final report (see the task as well) (2021-03)
- 2021-07-05: RB to schedule 1-1 talks with everybody about task assignment and optimal task tracking since everybody prefers different ways to track items and we don't seem to agree on 1 solution that works for everybody. (2021-02)
- 2021-07-05: Meeting minutes for each meeting saved as commit history of a single file in github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org (2021-01)


## Discussion items

Each new discussion item gets a number. It is OK that the same item may be discussed in several meetings. Please add items that you would like that we discuss.

### 2021-07-19

- [x] 2021-05: De-googling process: next step is to save feedback from "workshops" folder. One thing that will help RB is to help decide which data we keep and how we store and separate them. You can help by answering questions about this which are or will come to chat.


### 2021-07-05

- [x] 2021-04: Future of freshdesk and post-processing of feedback
  - Will we continue using FreshDesk?
    - The issue is that it is not really GDPR-compliant, but we do not have a better option right now. Any sugestions for a replacement?
    - We keep FreshDesk until the end of current period (unless somebody knows of a good replacement)
    - **How do other projects deal with support emails?**
  - Postprocessing of feedback received during FreshDesk emails:
    - RB has collected and annonymized them and they are in CodeRefinery HackMD (one document). Feedback from all previous workshops is on Google Drive.
- [x] 2021-03: Pre- and post-workshop survey: status and next steps. This data will be central to our reporting and also help RB preparing the talk at RDA Nordic (August 30; see "Information").
    - it would need what FAIR means, we have data on technique and tools and data how they changed their work after attending a workshop
    - usage statitistics can be a starting point for a Nordic survey/overview
    - help is needed so data can be made presentable on the coderefienry website
- [x] 2021-02: Task clarification for the rest of the current project period. (ref. [minutes from 2021-06-21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19KfHyGEH9_ZDbcmwq6EhQHJfKmV0taJgadjCam3KKP0/edit#heading=h.8diefinqvirx)"Administrative challenges for remaining months"). Should we revive the issue board? Or use the website? Or can we just use this document in future (top section) for tracking tasks?
   - due dates may help 
   - 1-1 talks about task assignment and optimal task tracking 
- [x] 2021-01: How to keep the meeting minutes for each meeting; 1) as commit history of a single file, or 2) by pushing to a new md file at each meeting.


### Freshdesk Support

RB watching support line until we organise next event.


## Information

- Webinar "RDA Nordic - FAIR research software" on August 30: https://rda-software-webinar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. RB will give a 10 minutes talk about our lessons learned and survey results.
