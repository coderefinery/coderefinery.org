## Decisions

Decisions made in the meeting should be listed with the item-number.

**Old decisions are listed in the section at the bottom**

- 2021-08-30: All exercise leads get a small gift and we invite expert helpers and volunteers and staff to a common lunch over video where we share a slideshow or videos which people can submit
- 2021-08-16: We go for online celebration event (both for safety reasons and for better inclusivity), making a doodle for a date and options on what to do but most probably it will be dinner voucher and optional game or something. (2021-08) 
- 2021-08-16: We will keep the decisions in this file and not delete with expectation that people will dig into commit history. There are different stakeholders who want to read decisions, not only CR staff. (2021-09) 
- 2021-08-16: Regarding 2021-10, NT and AF will take initial drafting for the 2 points (status, and how to become a client or sponsor) (2021-10)


## Discussion items

Each new discussion item gets a number. It is OK that the same item may be discussed in several meetings. Please add items that you would like that we discuss.

- [x] 2021-11: Planning community call Sep 20
  - One thing I have been asked to do and we have been postponing (for good reasons) is a call where we can do some workshop planning
    - RD will chair this event 
- [x] 2021-08: Celebration event:
  - online
  - dinner voucher
  - question: who to invite? (we don't need to discuss names but rather question is whether all ELs also? expert helpers? instructors? how far back?)
  - RB asked NeIC XT to cover dinner voucher for 20 persons (I was tired when being asked that question and didn't think) but perhaps 20 is not enough. happy to re-negotiate.
  - does the dinner need to be then scheduled? (dinner over video is perhaps weird)
  - but still it would be nice to have some event where we can all connect at least for a moment?
  - conclusions:
    - send small gift to all ELs
    - dinner voucher to staff and expert helpers and volunteers who have contributed much
    - slideshow made out of feedback during dinner
    - short videos can be submitted which can be added
    - add something entertaining to watch
    - lunch or dinner? lunch (we could use one of the staff meeting slots)
- [ ] 2021-07: Draft for [governance document](https://hackmd.io/uFIZF6x1TROxWwPCqGecsg). Very early stage drafty draft. Please comment/edit/ask.
    - 2021-08-16
        - Discussed with relevance to 2021-10. 
        - The governance should come after the vision is set and shared.
        - Community calls should be used as an arena for discussion including those who committed in-kind contributions in sustainability phase.
    - 2021-08-02
        - Who are/to be involved: everybody who is interested. Working group will be formed.
        - Clearly state that the goal is a non-profit organization
        - Clearly define what should be governed
        - Reference book: "[AGILE STARTUP BOARDS](https://www.boardmangrow.fi/content/uploads/2018/03/Agile-Boards-leaflet.pdf)"
        - Need to define minimum to be able to apply for funding (ex.) and have others join the project in-kind/volunteer.
            - First describe how to continue with in-kind model after 31.10.2021

## Archive of decisions

- 2021-08-02: Paid staff will attend "Community calls" as well, as this is to be where we will discuss more big picture and "interesting"-topics in-depth. However, community calls are also open to anyone interested in CodeRefinery. Community call topics will be defined at least two weeks in advance and communicated to the CodeRefinery community (email invitation for paid staff, twitter, website)
- 2021-08-02: Autumn workshop within the phase 2 is not prioritized to setting up the sustainability phase regardless of funding from NeIC or not (2021-11)
- 2021-08-02: Open House for making lessons citable to be held with paid-staff as "supposed to attend" and open to anyone interested (2021-06)
- 2021-07-05: Pre-/post-workshop survey will be processed for the talk on the 30th Aug at RDA Nordic and for the final report (see the task as well) (2021-03)
- 2021-07-05: RB to schedule 1-1 talks with everybody about task assignment and optimal task tracking since everybody prefers different ways to track items and we don't seem to agree on 1 solution that works for everybody. (2021-02)
- 2021-07-05: Meeting minutes for each meeting saved as commit history of a single file in github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org (2021-01)


## Archive of discussions

- [x] 2021-10: Please help documenting our status and goals
    - [Clarify current status of workshops and future plans](https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/issues/563)
    - [Clarify better on website how to become a “client” or “sponsor”](https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/issues/560)
    - Basically document very briefly what we know and don't know and what we want to get to at this stage since currently we don't document this to the world at all. One might get the impression that the project is over.
- [x] 2021-09: Proposal of change in format of this agenda/minutes file at every meeting 
    - [x] removal of older discussion items which were already discussed and got decisions (as it is in the older minutes) 
    - [x] moving older decision items to "archive" section at the bottom
        - RB: is that section getting too long?
        - NT: yes, it can get too long, but the older decisions still should be available in this document, thus moved to "archive" section but not "hidden" in commit history as old minutes.
    - [x] limit the "done tasks" to those which were done between the previous meeting and the current meeting at least when it is commited as a minutes
        - RB: is the document getting too long or why?
        - NT: yes, it can get too long. while decisions are important enough to be kept in this document, outdated done tasks may unnecessarily eats up space before one reaches another section.
