## Decisions

Decisions made in the meeting should be listed with the item-number.

- 2021-08-02: Paid staff will attend "Community calls" as well, as this is to be where we will discuss more big picture and "interesting"-topics in-depth. However, community calls are also open to anyone interested in CodeRefinery. Community call topics will be defined at least two weeks in advance and communicated to the CodeRefinery community (email invitation for paid staff, twitter, website)
- 2021-08-02: Autumn workshop within the phase 2 is not prioritized to setting up the sustainability phase regardless of funding from NeIC or not (2021-11)
- 2021-08-02: Open House for making lessons citable to be held with paid-staff as "supposed to attend" and open to anyone interested (2021-06)
- 2021-07-05: Pre-/post-workshop survey will be processed for the talk on the 30th Aug at RDA Nordic and for the final report (see the task as well) (2021-03)
- 2021-07-05: RB to schedule 1-1 talks with everybody about task assignment and optimal task tracking since everybody prefers different ways to track items and we don't seem to agree on 1 solution that works for everybody. (2021-02)
- 2021-07-05: Meeting minutes for each meeting saved as commit history of a single file in github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org (2021-01)


## Discussion items

Each new discussion item gets a number. It is OK that the same item may be discussed in several meetings. Please add items that you would like that we discuss.


### 2021-08-02

- [x] 2021-11: Starting the scheduling process for the last full workshop of phase 2
   - The mandate/committment for phase 2 has been fulfilled so "we don't have to prove anything" in terms of another workshop before October 2021
   - It can also be after phase 2 formal ends, can also happen in November or later, to not put too much pressure on the project since many other tasks have to be done
   - Consider a streaming-only workshop which would simplify onboarding, communication, and coordination
- [x] 2021-10: Community call one week from now, agenda: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/community-call
   - RB would appreciate some feedback before sending out emails which already seems late
   - Discussed more in a separate meeting
   - Email will go out tonight
- [x] 2021-09: "Ask Us Anything"- community call on the 23rd Aug; assignment of relevant tasks (planning, recruiting of volunteers in the community, dissemination, etc.)
   - RB will ask on chat and assign tasks
- [ ] 2021-08: Feedback on document about [celebration event](https://hackmd.io/jFc-3yDRRkKIwv57HqK-QQ?view)
- [ ] 2021-07: Draft for [governance document](https://hackmd.io/uFIZF6x1TROxWwPCqGecsg). Very early stage drafty draft. Please comment/edit/ask.
    - 2021-08-02
        - Who are/to be involved: everybody who is interested. Working group will be formed.
        - Clearly state that the goal is a non-profit organization
        - Clearly define what should be governed
        - Reference book: "[AGILE STARTUP BOARDS](https://www.boardmangrow.fi/content/uploads/2018/03/Agile-Boards-leaflet.pdf)"
        - Need to define minimum to be able to apply for funding (ex.) and have others join the project in-kind/volunteer.
    - To be continued on the 2021-08-16 
- [x] 2021-06: "Open house" event to make CodeRefinery lessons citable.
  - Doodle poll: https://doodle.com/poll/73pwmeyrxqamgn33 by the 4th Aug.
  - Staff are all supposed to attend (i.e. must to fill in the doodle), while volunteers are welcome


### 2021-07-19

- [x] 2021-05: De-googling process: next step is to save feedback from "workshops" folder. One thing that will help RB is to help decide which data we keep and how we store and separate them. You can help by answering questions about this which are or will come to chat.


### 2021-07-05

- [x] 2021-04: Future of freshdesk and post-processing of feedback
  - Will we continue using FreshDesk?
    - The issue is that it is not really GDPR-compliant, but we do not have a better option right now. Any sugestions for a replacement?
    - We keep FreshDesk until the end of current period (unless somebody knows of a good replacement)
    - **How do other projects deal with support emails?**
  - Postprocessing of feedback received during FreshDesk emails:
    - RB has collected and annonymized them and they are in CodeRefinery HackMD (one document). Feedback from all previous workshops is on Google Drive.
- [x] 2021-03: Pre- and post-workshop survey: status and next steps. This data will be central to our reporting and also help RB preparing the talk at RDA Nordic (August 30; see "Information").
    - it would need what FAIR means, we have data on technique and tools and data how they changed their work after attending a workshop
    - usage statistics can be a starting point for a Nordic survey/overview
    - help is needed so data can be made presentable on the coderefienry website
- [x] 2021-02: Task clarification for the rest of the current project period. (ref. [minutes from 2021-06-21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19KfHyGEH9_ZDbcmwq6EhQHJfKmV0taJgadjCam3KKP0/edit#heading=h.8diefinqvirx)"Administrative challenges for remaining months"). Should we revive the issue board? Or use the website? Or can we just use this document in future (top section) for tracking tasks?
   - due dates may help 
   - 1-1 talks about task assignment and optimal task tracking 
- [x] 2021-01: How to keep the meeting minutes for each meeting; 1) as commit history of a single file, or 2) by pushing to a new md file at each meeting.
