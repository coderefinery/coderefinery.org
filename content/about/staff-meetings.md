## Decisions

Decisions made in the meeting should be listed with the item-number.

**Old decisions are listed in the section at the bottom**

 
- 2021-08-16: We go for online (both for safety reasons and for better inclusivity), making a doodle for a date and options on what to do but most probably it will be dinner voucher and optional game or something. (2021-08) 
- 2021-08-16: We will keep the decisions in this file and not delete with expectation that people will dig into commit history. There are different stakeholders who want to read decisions, not only CR staff. (2021-09) 
- 2021-08-16: Regarding 2021-10, NT and AF will take initial drafting for the 2 points (status, and how to become a client or sponsor) (2021-10)



## Discussion items

Each new discussion item gets a number. It is OK that the same item may be discussed in several meetings. Please add items that you would like that we discuss.

**For older discussion items, please refer to the commit history of this file**

### 2021-08-16

- [x] 2021-10: Please help documenting our status and goals
    - [Clarify current status of workshops and future plans](https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/issues/563)
    - [Clarify better on website how to become a “client” or “sponsor”](https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/issues/560)
    - Basically document very briefly what we know and don't know and what we want to get to at this stage since currently we don't document this to the world at all. One might get the impression that the project is over.
- [x] 2021-09: Proposal of change in format of this agenda/minutes file at every meeting 
    - [x] removal of older discussion items which were already discussed and got decisions (as it is in the older minutes) 
    - [x] moving older decision items to "archive" section at the bottom
        - RB: is that section getting too long?
        - NT: yes, it can get too long, but the older decisions still should be available in this document, thus moved to "archive" section but not "hidden" in commit history as old minutes.
    - [x] limit the "done tasks" to those which were done between the previous meeting and the current meeting at least when it is commited as a minutes
        - RB: is the document getting too long or why?
        - NT: yes, it can get too long. while decisions are important enough to be kept in this document, outdated done tasks may unnecessarily eats up space before one reaches another section.
- [x] 2021-08: Feedback on document about [celebration event](https://hackmd.io/jFc-3yDRRkKIwv57HqK-QQ?view)
    - feedback so far points towards lightweight online event + dinner voucher
- [ ] 2021-07: Draft for [governance document](https://hackmd.io/uFIZF6x1TROxWwPCqGecsg). Very early stage drafty draft. Please comment/edit/ask.
    - 2021-08-16
        - Discussed with relevance to 2021-10. 
        - The governance should come after the vision is set and shared.
        - Community calls should be used as an arena for discussion including those who committed in-kind contributions in sustainability phase.
    - 2021-08-02
        - Who are/to be involved: everybody who is interested. Working group will be formed.
        - Clearly state that the goal is a non-profit organization
        - Clearly define what should be governed
        - Reference book: "[AGILE STARTUP BOARDS](https://www.boardmangrow.fi/content/uploads/2018/03/Agile-Boards-leaflet.pdf)"
        - Need to define minimum to be able to apply for funding (ex.) and have others join the project in-kind/volunteer.
            - First describe how to continue with in-kind model after 31.10.2021


### Freshdesk Support

RB watching support line until we organise next event.


## Information

- Community call Aug 23 agenda: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/community-call
  - we decided to change to "get to know CR" (more welcoming) instead of "ask us anything" (sounds like dividing between "us" and "them") 
- Brief update on preparations for the open house on citable lessons (JH), HackMD: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/citable-lessons
- Webinar "RDA Nordic - FAIR research software" on August 30: https://rda-software-webinar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. RB will give a 10 minutes talk about our lessons learned and survey results.


## Done tasks between the previous and this meeting

- [x] [JH, RB] organize meeting/open house to finalize the workflow for getting citable lessons in August.
    * Half-day Open House will be held on Aug 19, 12-15 CEST. The event is planned in [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/citable-lessons)
    * Everyone who contributed (github) will be added as contributor. 
    * Then we ask each contributor if they want to be an author.
    * Release “idea”: get both source + rendered in zenodo with one DOI for each release.
    * https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html
    * Also installation guides and manuals should be released and citable (they are very useful also and were a lot of work and are being reused in places)


## Archives of decisions

- 2021-08-02: Paid staff will attend "Community calls" as well, as this is to be where we will discuss more big picture and "interesting"-topics in-depth.
