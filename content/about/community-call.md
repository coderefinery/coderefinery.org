and how they can get involved or contribute or how their organization can get
involved.

We would like to reach researchers/students who are interested in receiving
training in research software development tools but also trainers who develop
or would like to collaborate on similar material.

## Introduction round


### Icebreaker question: How/where did you learn to use version control/ Git/ GitHub/ GitLab?

- university a few years ago
- When trying to use code aleady hosted publically, first command was git clone
- a colleague recommended it and gave me own "manual" and after that lots of trial and error and mistakes
- on my own, then took coderefinery workshop
- on my own, then took carpentry workshop
- Had been using the Bazaar version control from 2008, and then shifted over to git in 2017 on the initiative of a colleague in a joint project.
- Colleages suggested it for collaboration. I was working in an automation software company at the time. I learned a lot more on its proper use and potential from coderefinery.
- Had been using SVN version controll initially but we switched to Git for the common projects. Learning from a colleague and online resources first, then CodeRefinery workshops. I am only using Git/HitHub/GitLab for version controlling the projects I am part of right now.

- How to better publicize workshops
  - involve SSI/Turing and research data management organizations
      - try and get 'workshop orders' from them
  - get into universities mail listings

- How to order workshops, past and future
    - specific requests either by institutions, organisations, or students
    - CR could proactively facilitate and announce a few per year

- Mentorship platform for exercise leads
    - how to create/offer a place to ask/answer questions
    - mention this towards the end of the workshop for help beyond code or research, like career or anything else
