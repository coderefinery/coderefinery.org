### How to archive meeting minutes

- Send PR towards https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/blob/main/content/about/community-call.md
- In a second commit adjust this page: https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/blob/main/content/about/meeting-minutes.md
- There is no automatic HackMD-GitHub link yet. We can set one up but we do need to link to individual sessions to make browsing easier for those who don't want to inspect GitHub diffs.
