## Introduction round

If you intend to run similar workshops, can you please mention what are your goals? If you plan to help out as exercise lead or instructor, can you please mention?

If we are "too many" we only write it in HackMD:
- RB, goal: to make it easier for people/organizations interested to join
- SW, goal: helping with all aspects of CR
- SR
- SSH, goal: CR as a funded-project is coming to end (as far as I understand). I would like to help it continue the good work beyond that.
- JH, goal: I am eager to learn on what new lessons might be of interest for future CR workshops
- NT, goal: helping CR to be used by many of who are interested in and to be further developed.
- DI, goal: interact with the CR community and find out how to make CR better
- NA, goal: Keep in touch with the community, learn about the upcoming events and contribute.
- LF, goal: help in teaching/organising workshops, meet new great people and promote good open source practices.
- R, goal: I hope that CodeRefinery can continue as a teaching collaboration regardless of funding status.  I can teach/help/organize.
- MF: I like what CodeRefinery does and I want to get involved.
- JH
- MK, goal: Contribute to CR and help making it global
- RH, goal: Getting up to speed with what's going on with CR at the moment

## We are interested in

#### Outreach and accessibility
- How did we reach you and how can we better reach learners and exercise leads (ELs)?
  - I saw the announcements of the workshop on twitter

- Any knowledge on what prevented people from participating (eg organizational restrictions, 'too long', 'too much effort to install stuff', 'I am not a programmer')?
  - lack of understanding from management

- Why are you joining this community call?
    - a reflection on "why am I here": **I think the most driving factor for me to do work for CR (and hence join this call) is openness (as in open science), i.e. the open outputs we are able to produce together as a community**. It is absurd that many universities (and even companies) need to produce teaching materials that are never opened for public inspection or reuse *[Note that for many academic colleagues outside the software community, openness is just open access = paying the 3Keu OA fee to Elsevier to make the paper "open"]*. Closed-source teaching materials inevitably leads to biased materials (nobody is an absolute expert on everything) and can even result in poor quality materials (or poor quality teaching). Developing open source teaching materials (or even **open source documentation** to our HPC clusters) requires a community of people who wants to contribute. I knew the Carpentries before CR and I knew I could have joined that community and help developing those materials, but the psychological challenge of joining a team “where you don’t know anyone” can be big; combine this with the inevitable impostor syndrome that we all face at some point in our careers, it became impossible for me to join that community and contribute to their open teaching materials. When I was able to actually meet and help CR I felt that I belong to a community with people with a similar goal, independently of the fact of who pays the salary or which affiliation we have. We (you!) have produced amazing materials and all the process for doing so, the discussion on git issues or zulip, we have created a tangible record of an actual output that people can see, read, reuse. CR is not just another line for my CV, I can actually show the issues that I commented, the pull requests, where I was able to help, the codes I tested, the help I have given to our participants. And I can show to my next employer that I can actually help people with their coding workflows, debug code, write documentation etc etc. and all this is more valuable than an ECTS credit or teaching requirement for academic career and you can easily see how even more valuable it can be outside academia when you can take what you have learned and help other coders/researchers in private organizations.
    - I have to do this anyway so doing this as a community is a win-win. It is an investment.
    - I did not have these sort of training avaialble when I needed. I did not want others to go through this. :+1: :+1:
    - Believe it will help my career
    - Learnings and takeaways from the CR workshops and great lesson material that I use in my role as a RSE to help researchers develop competency in scientific computing skills.
        - How can we better value your contribution?
            - Get European credits (ECTS). At least suggest an amount. At least in Finland generally it's 27h = 1 credit. PhD students in Sweden as well can also get credit for additional activities.
              - "with this certificate we recommend N ECTS credits" might help participants to make them count

    - At Aalto - some extra credits for CR work (1 credit for helping)
    - Can Codefrefinary offer ECT credits
        - Summer school model
        - Home work or assignment if going for ECT
            - or special BOR (where hands on exercises are checked)
        -> assessment of learning outcomes
            - how to scale?
              - automate?
                 - As final "checkout exercise" create a repository which has some basic functionalities (some tests, docs, CI etc.) maybe can automate a workflow to check that the repository fulfills the criteria.

- Any institutions recognizing Carpentries/CodeRefinery teaching as part of PhD teaching duty? (at UiO Carpentries teaching can be counted as PhD teaching duty)
  - one institution does it on a case-by-case basis
  - if workshops could credit ECTS officially, it might be easier to motivate
  - at UU, there is no recognition related to teaching duties, as far as I am aware of; they only consider university-run courses


#### Contribution

- What are your expectations when you contribute and how can we/others help to reach those expectaitons?

- Do you feel your contribution is credited/recognized? How can we improve that?
    - Possible improvement: Archiving materials after each workshop in Zenodo, with all contributors as co-authors, with ORCiDs. I know this is tedious, but the contributor info could be community-edited in a hackMD doc or using some form to streamline it.
      - This is currently underway. We will make a concentrated effort to have lessons and other material released with DOIs, Zenodo etc. There will be an Open House to get this started on Thursday 19 August 2021 12:00 – 15:00 https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/citable-lessons
    - Journal publication(s)
    - Getting study points (e.g. ECTS) for helping, if possible (Samantha managed that in her situation). Should be on the certificate, for learners & helpers & instructors. Plus something to get counted as a teaching duty or experience (also for postdocs, researchers, ...). Learning outcomes need to be documented. See discussion above.

- Were your pull requests/ suggestions followed up and valued/appreciated?


#### Onboarding

- What can we improve in our onboarding to prepare ELs for workshops? (documentation and video call)
- Is the onboarding necessary?
- (for instructors) Did you feel 'onboarded' before the workshop?


#### Installation instructions

- Very few learners joined install sessions. Does it mean we don't need them? How was the situation in exercise rooms? Were there install problems you as EL had to solve which could have been solved earlier?
    - There still were some people who joined & needed the install sessions. Not so many, however, maybe due to really good install instructions(?). I personally (Matus) did not experience setup problems in a BOR in the last workshop (but yes in previous, before the instructions improved).


#### Teams

- Would you/your team like more follow-up support? What kind?
    - playground/repository where participats can do puzzles or other tests after the workshop to 'test your understanding' of the course materials (example Aalto: link?) -> full git workflow etc

- If you brought your own team, could it work if you managed them and we only communicated with you?


#### Post workshop

- Has it proven useful to you to have been volunteering a CR event? ie. could make use of things learned for work, used it in job application, met code collaborators etc.

- "post-workshop" hackathons (like https://coderefinery.github.io/2021-03-17-testing-hackathon/) are fun but a lot of work/participant, how could we make it scale to be able to offer more? Would you be interested in helping/mentoring/organizing hackathons?


#### More general questions/topics
- Do you have suggestion on what we should/could change? In terms of ...
  - Organization
  - Onboarding
  - Documentation
  - Lesson material
  - Lesson delivery
  - Lesson selection and order
  - Credit
  - Accessibility

Also written feedback here will be very welcome.

## Feedback about this meeting

What went well?
- Great topics but too many +1(but maybe it was the best this way, rather than pre-deciding what to focus on)
- informal setup 🙌🏽 :+1:
- discussion about ECTS: very important +1

What should we change/improve?
- Less topics
- Pre-decided themed agenda
    - lesson development / diversification +1
    - increasing collaboration with ELs before/after workshops for lesson development (encouraging PRs)
