# CodeRefinery community call

:::info
- Date: **Monday, September 06th**, 12-13 CEST / 13-14 EEST
- Invited: Everybody welcome
- Session chairs: Sabry Razick,
- This document: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/community-call
- Theme: CodeRefinery way forward
:::

This is a call for everybody who is curious to learn more about this project and how they can get involved or contribute or how their organization can get involved.

We would like to reach researchers/students/managers who are interested in receiving training in research software development tools but also trainers who develop or would like to collaborate on similar material.


## What do you get from this meeting?

Since 2016, the CodeRefinery https://coderefinery.org/ project has been teaching students and researchers how to write better code and providing research groups with software development e-infrastructure tools to support this. Between 2016 and 2021, about 1500 researchers from the Nordic countries have been trained. The long-term impact of CodeRefinery workshops, measured through post-workshop surveys (3-6 months later) shows that, for example, about 60% of our learners have improved their usage of version control.

The successful scaling to a large number of participants within individual CodeRefinery workshops given online during 2020 and 2021 has demonstrated the capability to host pan-Nordic workshops that reach a large audience.

The CodeRefinery project was kindly funded by NeIC (https://neic.no/) for the last 6 years. It is currently (as of August 2021) not clear if we can get further funding from NeIC. **Thus we need to plan the future prospect at this stage**

## Agenda

Suggestions and questions about topics not listed here always welcome.

1. Welcome and intro, presentation round (10) (Sabry)
2. Thoughts about CodeRefinery future (10 min)  (Radovan)
     - RB's slides: https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/reports/main/rb-ideas.md/ 
3. Participants 0,1 or 2 slides a proposed model or an existing example of an model (5 min each)
    - Lex ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18aInfiMnMvsG0tSOznTo_jfyIPSg0m3O/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117765752504171676718&rtpof=true&sd=true))
      - "Carpentries model": CR becomes a lesson program of the carpentries
      - RD: we should definitely become a lesson program somehow
      - RB: how long will this take?
      - Do participants have to pay in carpentries:  A: no, most people are volunteers, but you can still run workshops for free volunteer.  Other funding comes from member organization or applying for grants.
    - Jon
    - Richard ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vZ1XVKl4Zu03pkJxBHhgFVL2nlKvzA01GyzHx5idOzQ))
      - "Form an informal board/team/community structure to keep it going roughly like it is now"
    - Johan
      - Balance of on-site and online, benefit of Nordic focus, etc.
      - Hackathons & mentoring of projects as a complement to workshops
      - Alignment with in-kind partner interests and expertise
4. Discussion 
5. Zoom Chat Excerpt
    - [Urra] I agree with Richard, my fear is mostly with rigidity in materials and freedom to develop/use lesson materials.
    - [Thomas] Just out of curiosity, would joining mean that any Coderefinery courses would have to be given by "certified" instructors? I.e. would they have to pay to become instructors?
        -  [Richard] that is also sort of my concern, it makes collaboration more rigid.  I would like to activate more of my coworkers. the local community has been one of my favorite parts of working in coderefinery. for example, the idea of applying for EU grants requires some legal presence in Europe, in addition to carpentries.  so I think some local group is needed regardless of going global, if that is our goal
            -  [Lex] Yes, this is also a challenge for the Carpentries.
    -  [Radovan] it's really not about the countries, but about people and community - really good point
    -  [Max] Yes, the value of the CR learning-environment - “you will have achieved the first steps by yourself” is invaluable for acquiring the skills our participants come for. IMHO This participant-enabling approach and the flexible in-kind compensation/participation scheme are very strong vantage points for reaching out to potential sites. If we could make it easier to produce "workshops at home" with basic organization tools/support that would be yet another attractor. Ideally Organizers would write an email / fill a form, pick lessons and download materials (guides for local organizers, helpers, instructors, and per-lesson caveats), book a room, buy some cake, and have a branded, local CR workshop.  
    -  [Richard] so I guess we should put on a workshop "coderefinery lesson crash course for carperntries instructors".  similar to what we have done before
        -  [Radovan] or "hire (somehow) one of us to co-teach the first workshop with you"
            -  [Richard] If you can't hire us (university bureauocracy too much to be paid, combine course with us somehow and you teach in our courses and invite a bit of your audience.  online is good for this)
                -  [Radovan] yes! hire does not have to mean money, can mean collaboration or common benefit effort
    -  [Lex] my (biased) advice would be as an exercise go over the Lesson Incubation Roadmap and see what you think: 
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#lesson-program-incubation-roadmap
    -  [Urra] Speaking from TU Delft, but not on behalf of it it would be great if RSEs in our team can contribute/learn to Coderefineries. But also transfer your experience to the TU Delft. We also have the challenge of demand and the debates of organic vs top-down.

## Motivation for community calls

- Opening up for input and to get informed and be able to influence
- Better communication on what is happening and planned
- Make it easier to join or collaborate
- Every 2 weeks (but later we may adjust if frequency seems too high)
- Suggestions for community call topics welcome

### Questions

*ask your questions here*
#### Carpentries

- TP: Just out of curiosity, would joining mean that any Coderefinery courses would have to be given by "certified" instructors? I.e. would they have to pay to become instructors?
    - LN: An officially recognised Carpentries workshop would need at least one Carpentries certified instructors. It is still possible to organise workshops given by non-certifed instructors.
        - DI: Would these latter ones be advertised under the Carpentries webpage, or? LN: Yes.
- DI: Does one need to pay for participating to a workshop/course?
    - LN: Carpentries workshops are free given by volunteer instructors. A small fee may be chared to reduce no-shows, usually paid back in the form of free coffee/tea/snacks

- JU: Why would you need an organization at a global scale a priori? Are there alternative models like federating among real communities? Even though the carpentries is a "global" org as Lex mention it is heavily US centered. What would be a criteria for a global initiative that is sustainable and works for these different training communities?
    - LN: I see the issue with being a Nordic-focused organisation suddenly 'having to go' global. But the issue you are addressing and the problem you are trying to solve _is_ a global one. I have no good answer as to how keep the Nordic focus in a sustainable way. Are there good enough sources of funding?
    - JU: When you need to expand after succesfully running a program is a good situation to be. What is less desirable is to be pushed maintain a global organization that has not enough community back up.

- [DI] How would the funding model work in practise if CR is to go under the Carpentries umbrella? Would the current members of the project support "voluntary" work for the Carpentries? Or would they need to join as member organizations? Would this make collaborations within the Nordics harder? [I am not saying we should limit ourselves to the Nordics, just that we should not loose what we have already.] 



### Comment

- [DI] Great meeting today. I am a bit reluctant for CR going under the Carpentries, but it's also fair to say that I do not know enough about the organization. I like the welcoming spirit of the CodeRefinery and it's great how it has grown from more than developing and giving lessons into building a community. Also, not only promoting CR material but anything related that the community may benefit from. The way I see it, CR puts the interests and needs of the community first, which is very rare but very valuable.
