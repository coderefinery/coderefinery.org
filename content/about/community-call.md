:::


## Agenda

- (followup) CodeRefinery way forward
  - Has anyone followed up on any of these?
  - We now have a #carpentries chat stream
- Communications strategy / Announcement email list
  - Major problem: we have avoided creating any announcement list because of privacy, and keep going in circles.
  - Any suggestions for a minimum useful solution?
  - Mailing list allows sending an invite
- Joint workshops. How do we do joint workshops?
  - When should we do joint lists?  When not?
- Workshops for the autumn
  - Python-for-scicomp (Aalto, NRIS)
  - Julia (Aalto)
- Workshops for the spring

## Communication strategy

- We don't have a clear way of contacting people
- Last time we decided Zulip
- Ability to send a meeting invites would be nice
- Workshops vs meetings/events.
- Proposal: create a 'communications checklist'
  - When event time decided
    - Post on #announcements [template]
    - Tweet via coderefinery: "[title] will be held at [time CEST], follow more
      at our chat https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals #announcements or
      #coderefinery."
    - Anyone else should approve and merge the pull request after checking the facts.  If no one else merges in the next few hours, do it yourself.
    - Send calendar invite to relevant mailing lists
      - coderefinery: ...
      - nordic-rse: ...
    - Offer to send a calendar invite to anyone who requests it
        - via [DM] on Zulip?
  - Workday before event
    - Reminder on #announce
  - Day of event
    - Reminder on #announce
- Emails also easier to forward to others compared to chat messages
- One could aggregate messages to an announcement chat post but that would make coordination again more difficult

- Proposal
  - two main communication tiers: participants, community
  - participants: continue like now, notify-me, tinyletter, twitter, #announce stream forwarded from others.  Only for workshops.
  - community: everything in the checklist above.

- **Decision/action points**
  - RD puts this checklist into manuals (minus mailing list part)
  - RD makes other clarifications about subscribing to #announcements stream
  - We do *not* create new email lists right now but continue using existing tools but are less worried announcing them and announcing earlier.


## Workshop planning

- We begin next year, we don't try to plan any extra events this year.
- We want to know all dates by the end of the year.
  - create HackMD to collect dates: https://hackmd.io/-sfiE8YYQS285FpLFtnpPw
  - announce on chat
- If we have two big CodeRefinery workshops, what would be the optimal times of the year?
  - this way other organizations could adapt to it
  - a bit like summer school at PDC which is always in August and everybody knows it
  - coordinate with carpentries and/or HPC stuff
  - Spring: avoid Easter (before to avoid work in Easter).  Sweden, weeks 8/9.  Denmark weeks 6/7.  Decide via chat, before Easter.  Easter: FI=17.apr.
    - aiming at **late March 2022** which is hopefully far enough away from
      winter holidays and also well ahead of Easter holidays (Mar 21 - Apr 1,
      weeks 12-13)?
    - For the second big workshop: **September, towards end of month**

- **Follow-up**
  - find precise weeks via chat based on the suggestions above, discuss in chat.
