+++

The project idea/directive grew out of two courses given at PDC/KTH in 2014
and 2015, which focused on research software engineering tools and techniques.

The courses were popular and it was clear that the demand is not limited to
the Stockholm region and we approached NeIC to bring this project to a Nordic
level, both to have more impact, but also to connect instructors across Nordic
borders.

The first CodeRefinery workshop was given late 2016 and since then the lesson
material has evolved a lot and we have delivered many more workshops, both
in-person and online.

In 2018 the project has received follow-up funding from NeIC for 3 more years,
until 2021. In 2021 the project successfully applied to the NeIC open call
2021 for another 3 years, starting 2022.
