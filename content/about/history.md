The project idea/directive grew out of two courses given at PDC/KTH in 2014
and 2015, which focused on research software engineering tools and techniques.

The courses were popular and it was clear that the demand is not
limited to the Stockholm region and we approached the [Nordic
e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)](https://neic.no), a
state-funded Nordic public funding organization, to bring this
project to a Nordic level, both to have more impact, but also to
connect instructors across Nordic borders.  The first grant was
**2016&mdash;2018**, with NeIC, CSC (Finland), SNIC (Sweden), DeIC
(Denmark), and UNINETT Sigma2 (Norway) as partners.

The first CodeRefinery workshop was given late 2016 and since then the lesson
material has evolved a lot and we have delivered many more workshops, both
in-person and online.

In 2018 the project has received follow-up funding from NeIC for 3 more years,
**2018&mdash;2021**. The partners were the same as the first phase, but now
including the University of Tartu (Estonia). Aalto University
(Finland) formally joined the last year after being a long-term
voluntary participant.

In 2020, COVID-19 hit, and everyone went online.  We didn't take an
opportunity to do the same thing, but online, while waiting for things
to become normal.  Instead, we took advantage of being equally close
to each other (online) as to our previous in-person teams (now online)
to work together much more closely than we used to.  We developed an
extensive and unique [CodeRefinery teaching
style](@/workshops/teaching-style.md) which stayed with us even
post-Covid.

In 2021 the project successfully applied to the NeIC open call
for another 3 years, **2022&mdash;2025**.  The focus of this phase was to
produce a sustainable organization that can exist without NeIC's
funding. The partners at the beginning of the phase were NeIC, Aalto
University, Center for Humanities Computing (Denmark), Aalborg University
CLAAUDIA (Denmark), CSC (Finland), DeiC (Denmark), ENCCS (Sweden), NAISS (formerly SNIC; Sweden),
Sigma2 (Norway), and the University of Oslo USIT (Norway).

In 2024, the project successfully applied for a fourth phase, **2025&mdash;2028**,
with the following partners: NeIC, Aalto University (Finland), CSC (Finland),
Center for Humanities Computing (Denmark), DeiC (Denmark), ENCCS (Sweden),
NAISS (Sweden), NTNU (Norway), Sigma2 (Norway), University of Oslo USIT (Norway),
and the University of Iceland.

CodeRefinery now welcomes other partners to join.
