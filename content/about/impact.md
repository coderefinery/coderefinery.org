[Over 1100 people have attended a CodeRefinery workshop since the project
started](/about/statistics/#standard-coderefinery-workshops)! Since the pandemic started, we shifted the gear towards online workshops. In total 407 participated in online CodeRefinery workshops. 

Along the change in tools and practices, we changed questions in pre-/post-workshop surveys. To provide the most consistent and recent picture of our participants and impact, the below is based on data provided by pre-/post-workshop surveys answered in relevance to **only online workshops**. (Note: pre-/post-workshops are opt-in.) 


## Participants' background

Results of pre-workshop surveys (answers given by 301 persons) show that our workshop participants range from undergraduate students to full
professors, and come from a variety of academic disciplines. 

The chart below shows the result of a question asking about their job title, position or occupation.

Otherwise, less than 20 for each of the followings: research software engineers, professors, undergraduate students and other positions for each of the following positions. The results show few participants from industry")

## What is our impact?

The long-term impact of CodeRefinery workshops is measured through a
post-workshop survey which is sent out to all former participants 3 months to 1 year after attending a workshop. To date (12th Sep 2021) we received 80 voluntary responses to 
a post-workshop survey by participants of an online workshop.

The heatmap below shows how former participants
use various software development tools after attending a workshop, and
how their code and collaboration with colleagues has changed. 

*Please note that a part of responses answered the specific tool to different types of impact, for example, there are cases where both "started using" and "using better" was chosen for "Version control".*

heatmap based on the number of responses a matrix chart showing 4 impact levels on x-axix (from left, not using, started using, unchanged, and using better) and tools or practices introduced in the workshops on y-axis (from top, workflow, version control, Jupyter, Deploying documentation, Coverage, Code review, and Automated testing). 63 answered using version control better, and 35 answered started using version control. 30 answered using Jupyter better and 23 started using Jupyter. 21 answered deploying documentation better and 23 started doing so. 22 using code review better and 23 started using it. On the other hand, Many answered not using; workflows (62), coverage (62), or automated testing (57)")

The chart below shows fraction of former participants who feel their code and collaboration with colleagues has been improved.

showing fraction of participants who feel that their code is more resusable (0.59), more reproduceble (0.50), more modular (0.34), better documented (0.64), and that it is easier to collaborate (near 0.85) and incroduced tools to colleagues (below 0.75)")
