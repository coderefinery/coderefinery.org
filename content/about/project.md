## Objectives

We are working with **students, researchers, and research software engineers
from all disciplines** to advance software development and management practices, 
so that research groups can collaboratively develop, test,
review and discuss their source code, with the aim of making it shareable and reusable,
thus following the FAIR principles.

We serve as a hub for research software engineers in the Nordic countries, 
namely in Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Estonia.


## Core Activities

* We provide a code repository hosting service that is open and free for all researchers based in national universities and research institutes from Nordic countries.
* We develop and maintain training material on software best practices for researchers that already write code. Our material addresses all academic disciplines and tries to be as programming language-independent as possible.
* We offer training opportunities:

    * Carpentries 2-day workshops in the Nordics (6 workshops each year). The workshop fee is on us, only the instructor travel is on the host institution.
    * CodeRefinery workshops to grow researchers' software best practices skills. These workshops aim at consolidating knowledge learnt during Carpentries workshops and focus on teaching professional tools for efficiently developing and maintaining research software. In-person workshops are typically 3 days, while online workshops are typically 6 half days over 2 weeks.
    * Instructor training workshops to learn to organise and teach Carpentries and CodeRefinery workshops. Our train the trainer program aims at building partnerships with Research Software Engineers and researchers who are willing to lead skills' transfer within their local communities in the Nordics.

## Infrastructure services

Our [code repository hosting service](/repository/) is open and free for all
researchers based in Nordic universities and research institutes. Please
[contact us](/get-involved/#contact-us) if you would like to use these services.


## Training opportunities

We offer training opportunities to researchers from Nordic research groups and projects
to learn basic-to-advanced research computing skills and become confident in using
state-of-the-art tools and practices from modern collaborative software
engineering.


### Membership with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)

Since November 2018, [NeIC](https://neic.no) is a [platinum
partner](https://carpentries.org/members/) to [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org), an international project that comprises
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and [Data
Carpentry](https://www.datacarpentry.org), communities of instructors,
trainers, maintainers, helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach
foundational computational and data science skills to researchers.

With this we have access to:

- 6 [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) in the Nordics each year. The workshop fee is on us, only the instructor travel is on the host institution.
- 15 seats in the [Carpentries instructor training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) each year.

Carpentry workshops last 2 days.  Software Carpentry workshops include
introductory lessons on Unix shell, version control with Git and
programming in Python or R. Data Carpentry workshops are usually
tailored to specific scientific disciplines. An overview of Carpentry
curricula can be [found here](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/)

Please [get in touch](/get-involved/) if you would like to host a Carpentry workshop or become an instructor.


#### Level of Carpentry workshops

Carpentries workshops focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for
learners with no or little digital skills while our three day workshops are the next
step.
For beginners who don't yet write code but want to get started, we
highly recommend attending a [Software Carpentry workshop](https://software-carpentry.org).


### CodeRefinery Workshops 

The key objective of CodeRefinery workshop is to grow researchers' software
best practices skills to facilitate open and reproducible research.

* **In-person workshops** - We offer **three-day workshops** that focus on methods to build
modular, reusable, maintainable, sustainable, reproducible, testable, and
robust software.  These workshops are based on [training material](/lessons/)
we develop and maintain.
* **Online workshops** - Since April 2020, we offer both "full-package" workshops by 6 half-days over 2 weeks with the same contents as 2-day in-person workshop ([training material](/lessons/)) and shorter workshops focusing on one or a limited number of lessons. 
* **Requesting a workshop** - Would you like to host a CodeRefinery workshop at your home institution?
**[Get in touch](/get-involved/#contact-us) if this sounds interesting!**
Note that even though CodeRefinery is a Nordic project, we are interested in giving workshops
also outside the Nordics and are able to do so provided that funding for travel and
accommodation can be covered.

* **Information for local organizers** -  We have prepared [a list of practical requirements](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/workshop-requirements-inperson/).


* **Level of CodeRefinery workshops** - For CodeRefinery workshop, it is assumed that participants already write code for their research but no expertise is required.  Some experience in navigating
the file tree and editing files in a terminal session is recommended.
[Our workshops](/workshops/) are attended by MSc and PhD students, postdocs,
researchers and more senior staff from a wide range of scientific backgrounds
and with different programming experiences.


### Instructor training workshops

One purpose of our Instructor training workshops is to train
CodeRefinery instructors, but being (or becoming) a CodeRefinery
instructor is not required. With the workshops we also aim at building
partnerships with [research software engineers](https://nordic-rse.org)
and researchers who are willing to lead skills' transfer within their
local communities in the Nordics.

Instructor training workshops take 2 days and cover [this lesson
material](https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/).

* **Level of Instructor training workshops** - Learners should have some familiarity with good software development practices, especially in the context of scientific software, and be
interested in sharing knowledge and teaching.

### Other types of events

We have organized hackathons, get-together events and shorter workshops
customized for individual research groups. Regularly we also host
online Open House events where CodeRefinery instructors together with
a wider community of interested people work in sprints on topics
ranging from lesson development to website updates.

We're always interested in new collaborations, so if you would like to
co-organize an event with us or suggest a new type of event, don't
hesitate to [get in touch](/get-involved/)!
