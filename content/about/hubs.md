{{ hubs() }}


## Current hubs

* Aalto University, Helsinki region, sponsored by [Aalto Scientific
  Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/).
  Workshops every May (Helsinki)/December (Aalto) in partnership with
  the University of Helsinki.
* KTH, Stockholm, sponsored by [PDC](https://www.pdc.kth.se/).
  Workshops every March-April and October-November.
* NTNU, Trondheim. Workshops every February and October-November.
* University of Oslo. Workshops every June (and possibly more).


## Become a hub

To become a hub, please sponsor a first workshop, then a second, and then
eventually it becomes a regular thing. There should be at least one local
instructor who can regularly take part in other CodeRefinery activities and
several helpers.

To get started, consider attending another workshop as a helper
(optional), then [request a workshop](/workshops/), then [join our
chat and become an instructor](/get-involved/). When you would like
to be add to the list above, send a pull request.


## Hub cooperation

As part of the CodeRefinery sustainably plan, we hope that hubs can
share instructors in-kind: since a workshop needs at least two or
three instructors, instructors can travel between hubs so that we
maintain community, share knowledge, and continue workshops.
