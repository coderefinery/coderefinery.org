We have some goodies for you!

We rely on you to spread the word about CodeRefinery in your communities. For that we have got some goodies with our logo to wear or stick on your laptops: 

- Sticker small
- Sticker large (black/white)
- Sew-on patch
- Iron-on sheet (to make your own T-shirt, or decorate other garments or objects with)

All of those you can get at CodeRefinery events, if you meet us at conferences or upon request to support@coderefinery.org (on best effort basis).
