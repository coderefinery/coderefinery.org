## Zenodo community

Recently we like to deposit our presentations in the [Zenodo CodeRefinery
community](https://zenodo.org/communities/coderefinery/).  This way,
presentation slides don't disappear, they can be cited, and you can find them
all in one place.

You can also submit your own presentations or derivative work to the CodeRefinery community on Zenodo.
This community is not only for lessons but also presentations and reports.

## CodeRefinery project presentation slides

For a quick overview and in case you would like to add some slides about the CodeRefinery project to your own presentations, 
please check out our [short slideset](https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/presentations/main/2024-CodeRefinery-basic.md/) 
and find the source in `markdown` and LibreOffice Impress `odp` format in our 
[presentation repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/presentations) (named `2024-CodeRefinery-basic.*`).
