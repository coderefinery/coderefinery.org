CodeRefinery is an open-source project.  All our work is open, and we
accept any type of contributions: there is a lot more than instructing
to run a successful workshop.  Also, CodeRefinery is really more of a
group of like-minded people than one particular plan, so you are
welcome to join just to hang out and share ideas.

## Join our "community teaching training"

CodeRefinery isn’t just about doing teaching ourselves, but improving
your teaching. Whether you focus on teaching, or it’s a side-activity
to your other tasks, the CodeRefinery (online) teaching can help you
avoid re-inventing good practices and prepare you for teaching
together.

## Advertise and co-teach in our online courses

CodeRefinery runs many open, online courses, which anyone can
attend. Some of them can be attended by anyone via livestream, even
without registering (yes, this really works - we get high ratings for
this). You could simply advertise our courses, or go even further and
run local breakout rooms. Take it a step further and help out with the
teaching, too.

## Teach openly and allow others to join

Go to the next level and adopt CodeRefinery strategies for your own
courses, so that others can join at little cost to yourself. By
opening, you start to find more lesson developers and instructors, so
that your courses can reach the next level of quality and
impact. Soon, you will wonder why you ever bothered teaching alone.
