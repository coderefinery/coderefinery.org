CodeRefinery is an open-source project.  All our work is open, and we
accept any type of contributions: there is a lot more than instructing
to run a successful workshop.  Also, CodeRefinery is really more of a
group of like-minded people than one particular plan, so you are
welcome to join just to hang out and share ideas.

- The best way to get started is to [join our
  chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/) and introduce
  yourself in `#new members`.
- Subscribe to [@coderefine on
  twitter](https://twitter.com/coderefine) for announcements.

## Volunteer for a workshop

Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but
would like to attend another one to refresh your memory and share your own
knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background in research software
engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly
environment?  Join a workshop as an [exercise
leader](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/exercise-leaders/),
[helper](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/expert-helpers/), as a
co-instructor.  Because of our [team
teaching](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/team-teaching/),
being a co-instructor is actually the second-easiest way to get started!
You don't need to know everything, we work together.

Have a research group or some friends?  Form a team and be the
exercise leader.

## Advertise our workshops

CodeRefinery runs many open, online courses, which anyone can
attend. Some of them can be attended by anyone via livestream, even
without registering (yes, this really works - we get high ratings for
this). You could simply advertise our courses (to your institution or
research group), or go even further and
run local breakout rooms.

## Join our "community teaching training" ("instructor training")

CodeRefinery isn’t just about doing teaching ourselves, but improving
your teaching. Whether you focus on teaching, or it’s a side-activity
to your other tasks, the CodeRefinery (online) teaching can help you
avoid re-inventing good practices and prepare you for teaching
together.  **If you teach practical computing skills, you need this workshop.**

## Teach openly and allow others to join

Go to the next level and adopt CodeRefinery strategies for your own
courses, so that others can join at little cost to yourself. By
opening, you start to find more lesson developers and instructors, so
that your courses can reach the next level of quality and
impact. Soon, you will wonder why you ever bothered teaching alone.
