We are always looking for both **people and institutions** that can promote the
FAIRness of software management and development practice. There are many ways
that **you can join and get involved and help the project**:

## Help with the workshops

### As helper or exercise lead

Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but
would like to attend another one to refresh your memory and share your own
knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background in research software
engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly
environment? Join a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop as a helper! For more
information about what a helper is supposed to do, please
refer [Helper’s guide](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/helping-and-teaching/).
You don't have to know everything and be able to solve all exercises and
problems.  We will anyway prepare all exercise leads in an on-boarding session.


### Bring your team

Bringing a team of your colleagues or friends is a great way to participate in
a workshop: you probably "speak" the same programming language and academic
domain language, can use relatable examples, and already know each other. After
the workshops, exercise teams can form supporting groups for the weeks and
months after. And maybe one or two people from your team are a little bit more
familiar with the tools than others and then they can join as exercise leads?


### Co-teach with others

Join a workshop organized by others as a co-instructor. Co-teaching is a fun
and low-preparation way to get involved in teaching. Co-teaching is also a nice
way for learners to follow a dialogue instead of a monologue and to learn
different views about technologies and tools and techniques.


### Become an instructor

There is no requirement for using our training material. However, 
we suggest that most instructors start with [Carpentries instructor
training](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/). We have [instructor
training](https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/), but
this mostly serves as a complement focused on our lessons and more
intermediate users.

After taking either instructor training, you are welcome to
self-organize a CodeRefinery workshop or join a workshop as an
instructor when instructors are recruited via #workshop stream of
[CodeRefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/).

With that being said, there are no strict requirements to working with
us and learning "on the job": we help people organically grow from
learner → helper → instructor.  So far, the best way to get involved is to
join our chat and let us know when you see something you are
interested in.


### As research group

A great way to both benefit and contribute is to send the group as team:
contributing not only learners but also one or two exercise leads. This allows
us to scale and will be a great learning experience also for the exercise
leads.


### As group leader

- By helping us promoting our workshops in your group.
- Mentioning our activities to your colleagues at faculty meetings.
- Allowing your students and staff to participate.


### As organization

You can support us by:
- Allowing your staff to contribute in-kind and co-teach and co-organize with us: this is a great learning experience.
- Helping us advertise our events to your students and staff: the more help we get with advertising and logistics, the more
  your students and staff will benefit.
- Sponsoring our activities (see below).


### As sponsor

CodeRefinery is working on defining membership tiers with associated benefits
to continue its activities.  We will offer different options such as:
- Free membership with no in-kind trainers
- Free membership with in-kind trainers
- Basic annual membership
- Premium annual membership

We are working on defining the benefits for each option.


### Host a self-organized CodeRefinery workshop

The requirements for a self-organized CodeRefinery workshop are:
- Teach at least three CodeRefinery lessons (we recommend one from the section **For yourself and larger**, one from **For your group and larger** and one from **For the community**);
- Have at least one certified Carpentry or CodeRefinery instructor;
- Use CodeRefinery surveys to get evaluations and to help us collect feedback from the learners;
- Abide by [CodeRefinery's Code of Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/);

There is **no administrative fee** to run a self-organized CodeRefinery workshop. 

If your workshop fulfill the requirements detailed above, it can be listed as a
"self-organized CodeRefinery workshop" on our website. Please [get in
touch](/organization/contact/) with us since it is good for us to list
workshops using our material.


### Improving the course material

All our material is open. It is steadily evolving and you can help us making it better:
- [Reusing our lessons](/lessons/reusing/)
- [Contributing to our lessons](/lessons/contributing/)
- Also opening issues about errors or suggestions help
- Sharing ideas/suggestions for lessons we are missing

## Help the CodeRefinery project

CodeRefinery is more than bi-yearly workshops. There is many ways that you can become involved and help the project to continue.

We are collecting current to-do's all around the project (including the workshops) in our [collaborative document](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/CR_TO-DO). The best way to get started with those, is to join our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) and ask for more information.

### Shaping the governance structure

We are a community project and as such we are currently working at establishing
the CodeRefinery governance and you can help us shaping the governance
structure! The more diverse input we receive, the better the project will be.
We also seek help in establishing the project as a non-profit organization.
