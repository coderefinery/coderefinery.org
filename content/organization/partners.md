The main point of modern CodeRefinery is that everyone needs to
teach - why not work together?  The most important thing to realize is
that CodeRefinery is not necessarily a separate project to be
budgeted - **you must teach anyway, why not work together to get more
out of it?**

## As individuals representing the partner

There is no need for formal agreements at this stage.  A person can
see the benefit of CodeRefinery to their organization, advertise
workshops, contribute to them, and help their community (and others).

## Joining as a partner

The definition of a "partner" is still being decided, but roughly they
are institutions which have long-term and systematic individual
contributions.

For example, a partner would:
- advertise our twice-a-year standard CodeRefinery workshops,
  providing helpers, some co-instructors, and other organization help.
- Advertise one of their own courses to a broader audience
- Help out with a few workshops that other partners have opened

In return, you have a much broader and better training offering for
your own community and improved teaching competence by being involved
in our community.
