### We are a community project

Since 2022, CodeRefinery is a community project and a number of persons
contribute their work in-kind (typically 10% to 50% of their time), supported
by their organizations.

**And you can join us and contribute**. And we will soon here describe more in
detail the various ways how you (as person or as organization) can help the
project if you find the project useful and interesting.


### Instructors, helpers, and exercise leads

Our workshops would not be possible without the contributions from
[many speakers, instructors, hosts, helpers, and exercise leaders](/organization/contributors/).


### Our teaching philosophies

On [this page](https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/02-teaching-philosophies/)
our instructors share their teaching philosophies in short recorded videos.
