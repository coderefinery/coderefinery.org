### Feedback from the March workshop
  - We invite exercise leads to give us feedback
  - If you have no time to participate in this meeting, can you please leave us feedback and suggestions for improving the workshop from your perspective here in writing? Thank you!
      - it was a really great experience, thank you for organising it and putting so much time into helping this first time exercise lead feel prepared for the workshop! everything seemed to run very smoothly, and I really appreciated the amount of information transmitted to us before and after each session. I will definitely try to join another one in the future!
      - on the first day, I did not know how many participants to expect in the breakout room. it would be great to have an expected number, so the exercise lead knows when they can stop waiting for people to join and get on with the icebraker/activities.
      - I felt awkward writing breakout room status into the HackMD, as no-one else seemed to be doing it? Perhaps a section at the end of the HackMD, with all the breakout rooms already listed, so we are more "prompted" to report status, rather than having to actively go make our own (and feel awkward for being the only person doing it! :laughing:)?
      - I started to write the breakout room status in the Hackmd the 1st day, but afterward we kind of lived the sessions on our own, without much interaction outside out room (not good, not bad, I just write this as a comment). One point that could be improved, is having a schedule for the exercise leaders (as the one that was done for the first days), so we can plan our days accordingly to the time spent in breakout rooms. Another point is that it was not so easy to write in the hackmd when everyone was writing at the same time. No because of lagging issues, just because the text was moving all the time. Overall it was a success for out team!
      - Thank you for running such a great workshop! It really helped to know ahead of time which exercises would be in the breakout rooms, so I would suggest continuing to share this with exercise leads ahead of time (even better ahead of the whole workshop if possible) to make preparation more efficient. In my breakout room there was a strong preference for each person to work through exercises themselves and ask questions if needed, since everyone wanted to try things out on their own. Sometimes I missed logistical things that the instructors said (for example, there was one time when there was an exercise followed by a break, but my team missed that we should come back to Twitch for a recap before going on break. Another time, the instructors started going over the exercise in Twitch for participants without a team, but we didn't realize that and cut our breakout room short to listen). It would be nice to add details like that to the HackMD so that there is a record of them somewhere. Other than that, the HackMD was an amazing resource and worked really well. 
      - For us with in-persons groups sometimes it was confusing when exercise time started and when it finished, specially if there was a break afterwards. This happened to us more than once. I'd suggest, if possible, changing the livestream to just a big slide stating "exercise time" or something similar. Same goes for breaks. Perhaps a bell indicating the end of those periods would also be helpful.
      - I think you should only use Python all along the workshop. Using Julia in part of the lessons caused cognitive overload IMHO.
      - In some exercises the written lesson was not strictly followed and the instructors improvised quite a bit. This is a problem if learners fall behind because they can not "recover" if the type-along deviates from the notes.

### Feedback during meeting
- More help to background production.
- Some lessons felt a bit rushed
- Good to decide in advance what is to be taught
- Hard to help and write in HackMD at the same time (multi-tasking tricky)
- Hard to develop/show the learning path, which puts special demands on how the lessons are structured
- Make it clear that exercise leaders do *not* need to answer in HackMD.:+1:
- If you lose your pace, it is very, very hard to catch up (german load grows much faster than intrinsic load, and cognitive load explodes; domino effect, all pieces fall down and you cannot stop it). Try very hard to avoid these catastrophic de-synchronizations.
    - Maybe have "intermediary" starting points. I.e. putting in a bigger script that can be loaded to gt back in.
    - In in-person workshops, we had a solution to this: have a separate room where a helper can help the person cathing up. Can we replicate this in an online workshop? Stream and breakout room?
    - [name=rkdarst] to me this is the goal of the teams... but not everyone has one/we don't have enough staff.
- Overload of writing and reading tasks in 6 half days with 100s participants.
- Breaks: they should be longer, at least 15 minutes.
    - How often should breaks be?
    - Schedule can be flexible but break schedule shouldn't be.
- The workshop ends after regular lunch time in FI, should we consider starting a bit earlier?
- E.g. exercise leader emails sooner (needs more help to make it earlier!)
- Good pace
- Some exercises had too long intro.
- Balancing between long days / more course days / amount of content
    - At some point the workshop could be splitted to two/multiple events (content-wise)
- Email overload at the beginning (so many links)
      - would a portal page such as https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/scip/ help  ? :+1: 
- Many of the optional episodes - very useful
- Better organization Zoom BO rooms and ELs; some BO rooms did not have helpers from the beginning
    - Could there be a Zoom host that manages the BO rooms?
    - Is there a registration system that has features for creating/managing groups?
        - I think pre-defining groups is actually one of the issues (except for people who come in groups), as it is not flexible enough for a course where people tend to drop out, or join only on a later day. 
            - Can we do both: a few breakout rooms for people with no group (WITH ASSIGNED EXPERT HELPER, free to join and leave) and then if groups register then assign a room for them?
                    - We had this, but it was unfortunately not cleared enough that there should be an EL in all, at least most of the time.
- Friction due to different instructions for exercises depending on whether done in BO rooms or stream-along.
- Idea: lessons pre-recorded and exercises afterwards, possibly in the afternoon.
    - Thinking about the following: 4h course in the morning with lightweight exefcises, time free until 15:30 with many cool exercises, at 15:30 you reconvene with instructors who demo the exercises with a  
        - Con: hard to keep focus for 2h or so and wait too long for the exercise time to start.
            - One could have a mix of pre-recording for the lesson materials with exercise time, either in BO room or on-site rooms.
                - Or pre-recorded leactures and live comment or Q&A (alternating for like 2h with breaks ofc) then longer breakoutroom session.
- Suggestion: exercises without obvious answers should be done in BO rooms, those that have very clear solutions can be done as demos.
- Pre-recording vs. live teaching: the interaction among instructors and instructors-participants is nice and the fact that the instructors reach out to the HackMD for questions from the audience makes it trully interactive and appreciated.
