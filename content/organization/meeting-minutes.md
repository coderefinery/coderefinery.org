## Agenda and notes

- Welcome

- NeIC all-hands meeting
  - preparing poster for poster session
  - you can contribute here: https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/poster-session
    - add a note on how other NeIC staff can reuse and/or teach with us
    - add SW's nice slide graphics 
  - context: https://indico.neic.no/event/237/page/86-poster-session

- A number of blog posts have been published
  - https://coderefinery.org/blog/

- CodeRefinery project is on Mastodon
  - https://fosstodon.org/@coderefinery
  - you can help posting/replying/maintaining/editing
  - RD: unless more people want to do more with twitter, I'd say that we should make mastodon the primary.
     - RB: from my perspective the work is not the tweeting but the shortening so shorter posts help 

- Website reorganization
  - https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/pull/733
  - this will be followed by issue triage
  - motivations: make it more clear "how to join", "why to join" and what we provide, and where we want to go in the future. make relevant information easier to find
  - DI: lessons - add information about licenses and reuse at https://coderefinery.org/lessons/
  - DI et al: after the upcoming changes, let us share with our colleagues and collect feedback

- What do we want to be in the future?
  - Do we focus on the standard CR workshop?
  - Do we focus on sharing the CR+other workshops?
  - Should we advertise ourselves to the ENCC:s as a partner to make their teaching better?
     - and advertize towards national infrastructure providers
       - RD: if you ask me infra providers and similar are a good choice to target to: we know them well, they often need teaching.
     - this is also very relevant in the context of future of SNIC
     - visibility of contributing partners (e.g. PDC, KTH, Stockholm or UPPMAX, Uppsala University)
       - RD: Yes, website parter page can be improved.  It can even say "after you attend our courses, this is how you get follow-up support": https://coderefinery.org/branch/new-2022/about/partners/
  - What other options do exist?
  - RB: more visibility, more credit, more collaboration, transition towards open source project - like community governance
  - there will be meetings and events focusing on this good question. this is one of the main goals for 2023 to sharpen and communicate the answer to these questions

- Python for Scientific Computing workshop held
  - https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/
  - retrospective
  - RD: help needed: video editing
      - RB: instructions on how best to help are in chat? (I could watch some videos and create edit list files)
      - Yes, in chat, under 'video processing'
          - good. I will look ...

  - Spoilers are "collapsed" so you don't have to worry about seeing a spoiler accidentally 
      - :question: How to do the collapsed thing in Zulip?
        - like a code block (three backquotes) with highlight language of `spoiler`
        - also you can try "view source" for a post that you have already seen
