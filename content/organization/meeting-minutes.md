## Agenda and notes

Please add/comment "inline", as close to the topic/subject as possible, not below everything.

- Welcome, introduction round, and about these calls
- Upcoming courses:
- Workshop March 22-24, 29-31
  - https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-03-22-workshop/
  - Online, livestream: anyone can attend!
  - Some universities are running local exercise rooms (in-person)
  - exercise leads needed
  - need to clarify (in registration form) that streaming is not second-best option
  - 113 registrations, only 5 from Finland
  - 18 exercise leads
  - this is a very cool format!  Anyone want to join as a organization or individual? [the future of teaching](https://hackmd.io/KRqQirJ_Rn2SHcE-t1iAUg?view)
  - Q: how engaged are learners in HackMD form livestream?
    - [name=rkdarst] my estimate is 10x more questions than previous formats?
  - The signup link should also be put in the "How to join" page. I just spend quite some time looking for it :)
- Any other courses to co-advertise?
  - Aalto: debugging course? Dates? https://forms.gle/tT89so7V65wPd3sW9 (20-22 April)
    - Form needs Julia to be added
- Do you have any courses you want to open to others?
- Business case and project plan draft
  - Formal documents that will guide the project
  - For your information and comments
  - [Business case](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dvricdm9L0EAcdBMXvMkwkIE6gHQiVqW-C_WeeGXR5E/)
  - [Project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1re8kPSRsEoeuFkM-twNAhy2255JV-NxOj4HJIB3NUKo/)
  - Main takeaway: We need good surveys for the workshop attendees, in order to report back to NeIC.  The business plan provides a very good starting point for what to measure.
- Some contributing/organization PRs to look at
  - Get involved
    - https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery.org/pull/646
    - https://coderefinery.org/organization/get-involved/
  - Partners
    - https://coderefinery.org/organization/partners/ 
  - Governance
    - https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/pull/186
    - later this should be also more visible on the website
  - Do these make good sense to partners?
  - Q: If material is developed through carpentries-incubator or other forms, could that be taught through CR?
    - Yes, why not!  We should be neutral as to source of material
- Calendars: how to stay in touch
  - https://coderefinery.github.io/calendar/
  - https://github.com/coderefinery/calendar  (CR event data)
  - https://github.com/coderefinery/git-calendar (base project)
  - RB suggestion:
    - we make this visible on coderefinery.org
    - in there we make very clear how to subscribe and how to add events 
    - TODO: add instructions of how to add/modify events.
        - Make this as easy as possible for people.
    - can we make a work session on this and then market it with a blog post?
    - 
- Mailing list? - how to attract people to these meetings?
  - institutional mailing lists **with a calendar invite** attached seem to be the most effective 
  - NeIC has mailing lists, RB can create them.  The interface may look old, but it does work!
  - what lists?
    - coderefinery-team: open subscription, any member may send, calendar invites to team events
    - coderefinery-announce: open subscription, staff can send.  For learners and people who in general want to be involved
    - Do interested learners still primarily use the notify-me form?
    - tinyletter for the newsletter?
- Next meeting
  - March 28, 14-15 CET / 15-16 EET
  - any volunteer(s) to prepare, announce, lead, and archive the March 28 meeting?
