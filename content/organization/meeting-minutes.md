### Welcome
- Welcome, introduction round, and about these calls
    - Date: 2022-05-02
    - Present: RD, RB, DI, SS, MJ, SW
- Review of recent courses
  - CR online
  - We have noticed very low attendance in recent courses (except the massive ones)
    - yes, same for others
    - Time of the year?
    - Returning to office?
    - Online you are unknown, no one will know if you are missing?
- Summer/autumn course schedule
  - Aalto HPC kickstart: June 6,8-9 (T,Th-F), 2022
  - CodeRefinery, September 20-22 and 27-29, 2022 (goal is to open registration end of May)
  - Python for Scientific Computing: dates unknown, autumn
    - October/November would be a good time
    - In TLDR advertisement text communicate the format and spirit and how people and groups can participate and contribute
- Getting large audiences for autumn CodeRefinery and Python for SciComp courses
  - These will be online, streamed courses: anyone can attend
  - We have had good success with local in-person rooms for exercises, to go along with large-scale teaching.
  - Local breakout room description (the kind of thing we can send to our colleagues to get them interested): https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/local-breakout-rooms/
    - TODO: at least the flowchart there needs updating for breakout rooms.
  - What about Zoom breakout rooms?  Maybe not focus on it as a main thing, but we can if someone offers to manage it.
  - Focus on teams?
  - **local organizers** are most important
  - As part of registration, ask about attendance style: "I want to just watch", "I will attend in-person room", "I will attend zoom", I will attend everything for sure".  Part of the registration hackathon.
    - Registration form has to describe what the attendance options work, or else we get random answers!  (not just on the webpage).  E.g. "Livestream only means that you can watch from anywhere and get assistance in writing." This could be done with a tooltip to give more info at registration time where many perhaps do not spend much time.
    - Can we offer participants to change their mind? +1
- Upcoming internal hack-workshops:
  - Tomorrow afternoon, improving workshop registration
    - goal: design how the ideal registration form could look like
    - couple of options are offered and participants can select multiple that apply to them (plan to attend live stream, attend in-person, ...)
    - for large workshops we are not after precise numbers but approximate
    - we need to be careful to not confuse with too many options
         - More options appearing if "yes" is selected
    - how about offering a "yes" and "interested"?
         - there is no consequence for not showing up currently
         - "yes" people should be more committed to appear
             - maybe ask "yes I will be there or I will cancel"?
         - "interested" can be asked about whether they want eg. emails or reminders about the event
     - start by creating a prototype example of your prefered registration
  - 18.may, measuring impact of CR workshops
    - For reference, this is what we do today: https://coderefinery.org/about/statistics/
      - PR for past workshop is open in case you wonder where the data for the March workshop is
    - How to report stream statistics?
      - Twitch offers data export for view as function of time or views by location
      - Is there an API for viewing data/analytics?
- Short Instructor training in summer
  - The best time to go hands-on with CodeRefinery teaching methods
  - More like a discussion then a lecture event
  - Some hands-on, demos, lots of discussion
  - Preparation for bigger training in the autumn.
  - Does anyone want to help prepare this?
    - Yes! RB
    - :man-raising-hand: MJ
    - Stephan Smuts :man-raising-hand:
  - name is wrong: this is not training for *instructors* but for the "how to put on workshops in the online age"
  - Proposal: 1/2 day, June ~~15th~~ 21st, 3.5 hours with breaks.
    - Focus: how to streamline online teaching (not "instructor training")
    - RB: June before Jun 18 is difficult for me unfortunately for delivery but I will have time for preparation
    - workshop on co-teaching
    - workshop on setting up quality screenshare
- Reminder: CodeRefinery calendar:
  - https://coderefinery.github.io/calendar/
  - There seem to be some remaining quirks with it (mac calendar?  )
