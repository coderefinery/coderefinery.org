    - +1
    - What are the common things (already prepared) that we can re-give easily?
        - instructor training/community teaching basics, ~1 hour, based on subset of https://coderefinery.github.io/community-teaching/
        - "Future of Teaching" (too much like above?) that RD has given: https://hackmd.io/KRqQirJ_Rn2SHcE-t1iAUg?view
        - ???
- Draft governance charter
  - we need to revive it 
  - Where are the previous charter ideas?
    - https://hackmd.io/uFIZF6x1TROxWwPCqGecsg
- Onboarding for new colleagues
    - Some new staff joining UiO and what is least scary way for them to get onboard 
      - Introduce issues in GitHub as some easy tasks and that nothing is obligatory
    - The chat is too much as the first step 
      - Yes Zulip needs an own "onboarding" like what to follow and how the threads/streams/topics work
    - RD: my feeling is that co-working is needed (one-on-one or small groups): can we find projects big enough for two people but not too big to do with them?
    - ASC garage: 1 h on Zoom every day where users can come and ask questions. This turned out to be very effective way to onboard new staff, even when not in-person, since you see other people getting helped and next time you might help them.  Post-help, we discuss more background.
    - "buddy system": new staff is assigned one person/mentor/buddy who can help navigating things and answer questions
    - invite new staff and those interested to join as exercise lead in the March workshop since it's a relatively low-commitment and low-preparation way to see the content and form in practice
    - Specific tasks which someone can do for next workshop:
       - Registration coordinator
       - co-instructor
- Next meeting
  - Feb 6
  - any special topic to announce? 

Follow up todo items that bubbled up:
- newsletter to recruit: RB
    - RD can help
- landing page for those interested in co-preparing and co-teaching: RD
- poster changes (see above)
