## Agenda and notes

- Welcome
- Twitter strategy
  - Currently CodeRefinery has 809 followers on Twitter
  - The original plan for today's meeting was to discuss good/recommended practices for Twitter outreach and to create few educational one-liners "did you know this neat trick: ..." and to queue them so that we can post one each week
  - However, Twitter has in the last days not been an optimal place but such one-liners will be useful anyway
- Inspirations for Twitter/Mastodon outreach
  - our goal: promote events from our network and engage users with good practices
  - tread with motivations why and with funny memes generated a lot more engagement than a single tweet: "workshop next week"
  - adding/finding gifs a bit less easy on mastodon
  - tweets with pictures work better: more screenspace
    - can twitter cards be used in mastodon? I suppose no so is there double work?
  - when posting links, check the twitter card preview
  - visibility on Twitter for academic questions decreased last week since the changes within the company
  - we also need to interact with likes/retweet to engage others, not only tweet
  - if we retweet, it makes it also more interesting to follow
  - location card can be used to get easy sign up for newsletters
  - pinned tweets are useful
  - short quote/ personal comment and a link is better than just the link for engagement
  - throw-back moment: repost something from the past
  - follow-friday: each friday we recommend few handles to follow
  - hashtags very important on mastodon
  - quality/quantity: no need to filter ideas too much
- Topics for daily/weekly tweets/toots:
  - Reuse the TIL thread
  - Terminal tricks
  - Git tricks
  - Philosophical thoughts/questions
  - create Zulip topic under `#general` where we can post ideas and if they get enough "upvotes" and this becomes a queue for tweets and somebody/somegroup weekly posts one thing from that queue
- Mastodon account created: <https://fosstodon.org/@coderefinery>
  - any tools for multiple people to use mastodon account? ideally we would like to share access by granting accounts access.
  - Mastodon has nice API, also all accounts have RSS feeds by construction so RSS-aware people can follow without even having an account
  - do we want to automatically re-post/mirror?
    - anybody has pointers on how to do that?
    - can we have it in [twitter repo](https://github.com/coderefinery/coderefinery-twitter) as parallel?
  -  <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/toot-together>
      - we should use the same repo with 2 workflows
- Reviving newsletter
  - RB is (too slowly) working on this. Draft will be shared this week.
- Next meeting topic
