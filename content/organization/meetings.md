## Team meetings

Every Monday at 14 CET/CEST. Except the first Monday of the month where we have a
call with more community focus (see below).

Scope: Making sure everything fits together; improving the processes, website
and documentation; information exchange; bouncing ideas off others. This is
the place where day-to-day decisions are made, but any major decisions will
also be discussed in chat, over several weeks, or in other meetings
such as the community call or with the steering group. Despite the
name, everyone is welcome to this event too.

### Archive of past staff meetings

These were meetings about administrative tasks such as generation of reports
and deliverables, involving paid staff.  In Autumn 2021, with the end of phase
2 of the project, we dropped the distinction between "staff" and "non-staff"
and dropped the separation between staff meetings and community calls and
started to focus on community calls.
