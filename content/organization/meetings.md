### Archive of past staff meetings

These were meetings about administrative tasks such as generation of reports
and deliverables, involving paid staff.  In Autumn 2021, with the end of phase
2 of the project, we dropped the distinction between "staff" and "non-staff"
and dropped the separation between staff meetings and community calls and
started to focus on community calls.
