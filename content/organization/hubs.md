From October 2016 to October 2021, CodeRefinery was a project funded by [NeIC](https://neic.no/) and the CodeRefinery community is amazing! We would like to continue providing similar services after the end of the project. 

Our plan to make CodeRefinery sustainable:
1. CodeRefinery governance;
2. CodeRefinery Kickstarter campaign to be able to register CodeRefinery as an independent foundation;
3. CodeRefinery membership

## CodeRefinery governance

We are currently working at establishing the CodeRefinery governance.

## CodeRefinery Kickstarter

We need your support to spin-off and register CodeRefinery as a foundation in one of the Nordic countries.

CodeRefinery is working on setting up a kickstart campaign to raise the necessary funds.

If you are interested, get in touch with us on [https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) in #coderefinery stream. 

## CodeRefinery membership

CodeRefinery is working on defining membership tiers with associated benefits to continue its activities. 

We will offer different options such as:
- Free membership with no in-kind trainers;
- Free membership with in-kind trainers;
- Basic annual membership;
- Premium annual membership;

We are working on defining the benefits for each option.

## Hub cooperation

As part of the CodeRefinery sustainability plan, hubs will allow to
share instructors in-kind: since a workshop needs at least two or
three instructors, instructors can travel between hubs so that we
maintain community, share knowledge, and continue workshops.

## Current hubs

* Aalto University, Helsinki region, sponsored by [Aalto Scientific
  Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/).
  Workshops every May (Helsinki)/December (Aalto) in partnership with
  the University of Helsinki.
* KTH, Stockholm, sponsored by [PDC](https://www.pdc.kth.se/).
  Workshops every March-April and October-November.
* NTNU, Trondheim. Workshops every February and October-November.
* University of Oslo. Workshops every June (and possibly more).


## Become a hub

To become a hub, please sponsor a first workshop, then a second, and then
eventually it becomes a regular thing. There should be at least one local
instructor who can regularly take part in other CodeRefinery activities and
several helpers.

To get started, consider attending another workshop as a helper
(optional), then [request a workshop](/workshops/), then [join our
chat and become an instructor](/get-involved/). When you would like
to be add to the list above, send a pull request.
