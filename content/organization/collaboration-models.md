Over the last two years, the following collaboration models and a progression
from idea/suggestion to collaboration have emerged and here we try to put this
progression into words so that we can elaborate on it and improve it further.


### It starts with an idea

A number of collaborative workshops and events have started with someone
sharing the seed of an idea: it could be an existing course or not, it could be
a requested course or workshop or their own idea. At this stage they think that
sharing it would be good, at least to keep others informed.


### Collecting feedback and help

Then, at an early stage, this gets announced to other possible instructors
along with possible collaboration models. It is rare that someone will join as
a primary organizer. However, it is often easy to join as co-teacher, helping
to prepare materials, giving feedback, being around to help answer questions,
or help with advertising. Collaboration models can vary depending on the type
of the course: A lecture/MOOC type thing can directly have others attend. If it
is very hands-on, other partners would be expected to mentor their own groups.


### Sharing knowledge by working together

By working together, we share knowledge both internally and with our users.  To
make this possible, it is important to have a way to quickly share our plans at
an early stage, and to have enough spare time and management support to join
courses that others may be proposing to develop better and more open materials
than we would alone. Courses organized across organizations and borders cannot
get away anymore with closed course material - the material has to be open.
And open material and collaboration benefits everyone, even organizations who
were not part of the initial collaboration.
