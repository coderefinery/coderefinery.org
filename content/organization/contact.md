### Zulip

We use [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com) to discuss within our team and community.
We discuss in the open and you can join us on
<https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com>: you can listen in, follow
certain threads, participate, and influence. [Learn how it
works](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/).


### Support line

To ask questions about workshops or services or to report issues:
[support@coderefinery.org](mailto:support@coderefinery.org)


### Announcements mailing list

Here we will inform you about upcoming workshops, hackathons and other events.
This is a low-traffic mailing list with 1-5 messages per month:
