CodeRefinery is a community project.  All our work is open, and we
have both individual contributors and people contributing on behalf of
organizations.  Our goal isn't just to run workshops but to support
*all* researchers in computational science.  You are welcome to hang
around if you just want to see what we do without contributing (also
see [Nordic Research Software Engineers](https://nordic-rse.org),
which has a lot of overlap with us).

## Individual contributors

If you are alone, there are still plenty of things you can do!  We
welcome people teaching with us, helping out in other ways, giving us
ideas, and generally being around.  Some people use their work with
CodeRefinery very advantageously in their career later.

- [Join our meetings](/organization/meetings/)
- Stay up-to-date on all events and meetings by subscribing to one or more of our [Calendars](https://coderefinery.org/calendars/)
- The best way to get started is to [join our
  chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/) and introduce
  yourself in `#new members`.



## Individual contributors on behalf of an organization

If you are working on behalf of an organization, you probably have

- [Reuse our lessons](/lessons/reusing/)


## Organizational partners

  partner](/organization/partners/)



accept any type of contributions: there is a lot more than instructing
to run a successful workshop.  Also, CodeRefinery is really more of a
group of like-minded people than one particular plan, so you are
welcome to join just to hang out and share ideas.




## Volunteer for a workshop

Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but
would like to attend another one to refresh your memory and share your own
knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background in research software
engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly
environment?  Join a workshop as an [exercise
leader](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/exercise-leaders/),
[helper](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/expert-helpers/), as a
co-instructor.  Because of our [team
teaching](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/team-teaching/),
being a co-instructor is actually the second-easiest way to get started!
You don't need to know everything, we work together.

Have a research group or some friends?  Form a team and be the
exercise leader.

## Advertise our workshops

CodeRefinery runs many open, online courses, which anyone can
attend. Some of them can be attended by anyone via livestream, even
without registering (yes, this really works - we get high ratings for
this). You could simply advertise our courses (to your institution or
research group), or go even further and
run local breakout rooms.

## Join our "community teaching training" ("instructor training")

CodeRefinery isn’t just about doing teaching ourselves, but improving
your teaching. Whether you focus on teaching, or it’s a side-activity
to your other tasks, the CodeRefinery (online) teaching can help you
avoid re-inventing good practices and prepare you for teaching
together.  **If you teach practical computing skills, you need this workshop.**

## Teach openly and allow others to join

Go to the next level and adopt CodeRefinery strategies for your own
courses, so that others can join at little cost to yourself. By
opening, you start to find more lesson developers and instructors, so
that your courses can reach the next level of quality and
impact. Soon, you will wonder why you ever bothered teaching alone.
