### Welcome to the first CodeRefinery hackathon!

The idea behind this event is to bring together people who are working with
code and/or data in research, in an informal environment where ideas can be
exchanged, expertise shared and real work done!
This hackathon is suitable for both experienced computational scientists
and newcomers who still have things to figure out.  We'll make sure that
everyone can learn something.

#### What you can do at the hackathon

- Participate in a **2-day project**
- **Bring your own code or data** and get suggestions/help on how to better organize, test,
  document, and share your code.
- Participate at a **ReproHack** where we try to reproduce a nominated paper (can be your own paper!) and learn how to make
  software papers better reproducible.
- Develop a **new CodeRefinery lesson**.
- **Share your expertise** with others and learn many new tricks and tools from others.


#### 2-day project: bring your own project (code or data)

You are working on a software development project on your own or as a team and
would like to apply best software practices to your project. Or
you do not have a project yet but would be interest to join a team and learn
how they adopt best software practices: as an external
participant, you will be able to give accurate and important feedback and learn
what are the important steps in the context of a real project.

It is also OK to suggest building something new within the hackathon.

To participate in this session, please propose a project. For this please
email us a project title and an abstract.
Please provide us with some background information about your code/data.

Here is the [list of project proposals that we have received](https://github.com/coderefinery/hackathon-2019/blob/master/README.md).


#### ReproHack

ReproHacks are one-day reproducibility hackathons where participants reproduce
papers from published code and data. We will be running two ReproHack sessions
during our hackathon.

To participate in the ReproHack, please nominate one paper which we will try
to reproduce as a group (please email a suggestion to us). You can nominate your own paper and then you get
feedback about how to improve your own work.

Here is the [event page](https://github.com/coderefinery/reprohack-2019/blob/master/README.md).


#### Develop a new CodeRefinery lesson

Would you like to participate in the development of new CodeRefinery lessons?
We are listing a few ideas below but do not hesitate to contact us for new
subjects!

- New lesson on web scraping
- New lesson on regular expressions
- Add R examples in all CodeRefinery lessons (such as automated testing, documentation, etc.)
- Generalize the automated testing lessons to a selection of programming languages


#### Share your expertise

We will schedule short informal presentations where you can show something
cool you have built or learned.
