### Welcome to the CodeRefinery Open House where we collaboratively work on **making lessons citable and giving credits for contributors**!

CodeRefinery is organizing a half day online "open house" dedicated to
collaboratively working on making CodeRefinery lessons citable as well as giving credits for contributors!
Here, contributors are not only those who developed lesson materials, but also lesson mainteners.

Anyone interested is welcome to contribute to discussion on how to realize these in practice!

We will collect notes in a [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/2020-10-02-openhouse).
Please note that this document will be archived in our [Open House
event repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/open-house).

We first meet online at 9:00 am (CEST) / 10:00 am (EEST) via video (connection link
will be shared in our [shared document](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/2020-10-02-openhouse). 
If we decide on working individually during the day, we will coordinate
the work through our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com)
with possibilities to further discuss via video if necessary.

We conclude the day around 12:00 pm (UTC+1).
