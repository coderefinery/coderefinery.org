### November 25 - December 6, 2019, Université de Lille

This is a two-week course co-organized by CodeRefinery and Université de Lille,
funded by the Department of Physics, Faculty of Sciences, Université de Lille.

The event is open for all but since the number of seats is limited, priority
will be given to participants affiliated with the University of Lille.


#### Location

Université de Lille campus; room to be announced.


#### Format

Hands-on informal and interactive event with type-along type of
presentations, live coding and demos. Short tutorials alternate with practical
exercises.


#### Course goals

The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize
the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research
software development. The main focus is on professional tools
for efficiently developing and maintaining research software.
Since most research code is developed in a collaborative
setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate
this process. Most of the content is also relevant to
a single developer.


#### Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this course is for you.  Most participants are not
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.

If you develop research code and you know all the tools
already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn
something new about a subject by teaching it.


#### What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.


#### Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit text files in the terminal.
- Basics in at least one programming language.
- You will need to bring a laptop.
- It is good if you have access to Eduroam.
- You need to install some software. You will get information about this closer to the course.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from the basics, but please go through <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/">this Git-refresher material</a> for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
