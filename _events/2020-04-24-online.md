### Welcome to the CodeRefinery Open House where we collaboratively work on **writing newsletter articles and blog posts**!

CodeRefinery is organizing a one day online "open house" dedicated to
collaboratively writing up blog posts which have been in 
the pipeline for some time and which will be published in the next 
CodeRefinery newsletter.

Tentative list of articles:
- Online lessons, what we're working on, how we'll be delivering online workshops
- Merge vs rebase
- Nordic-RSE conference
- NordicHPC tools

Anyone who would like to contribute to these articles or suggests new
topics is welcome to join!

We will collect notes in a [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/46XkhCr5T4yahKprL6N01A).
Please note that this document will be archived in our [Open House
event repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/open-house).

We first meet online at 9:00 am (UTC+1) via video (connection link
will be shared in our [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/46XkhCr5T4yahKprL6N01A) and then work on
the instructor training material. During the day, we will coordinate
the work through our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com)
with possibilities to further discuss via video if necessary.

We conclude the day around 4:00 pm (UTC+1) by writing a short
/summary in our [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/46XkhCr5T4yahKprL6N01A).
