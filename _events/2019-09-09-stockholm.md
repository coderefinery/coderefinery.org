### September 9 and September 12 2019, KTH 

Location: Room 304, Teknikringen 14, floor 2, KTH Main Campus.

### Course goals

The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize
the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research
software development. The main focus is on professional tools
for efficiently writing and maintaining research software.
Since most research code is developed in a collaborative
setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate
this process. Most of the content is also relevant to
a single researcher.
