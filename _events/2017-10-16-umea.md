goals:
       The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize the workshop participants with 
       version control systems, specifically Git. Both introductory and more advanced topics will 
       be covered. Research code is often developed in a collaborative setting, and we will 
       discuss tools and workflows which facilitate this process. However, most of the content is 
       also relevant to a single developer.

format:
       Hands-on informal and interactive one-day event with type-along type of presentations, 
       live coding and demos. Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises.

whofor:
       If you are writing code that is used in research, then this course is for you.
       If you develop research code and you know all the tools
       already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn
       something new about a subject by teaching it.

nottaught:
        This is not a course about a specific programming language or
        the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
        language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
        language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
        Python.

prerequisites:
       <li>You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit text files in the terminal.</li>
       <li>Basics in at least one programming language.</li>
       <li>You will need to bring a laptop.</li>
       <li>It is good if you have access to Eduroam or the local University wifi.</li>
       <li>You need to install Git. Please follow our <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/" target="_blank">installation instructions</a> and follow the instructions for Git.</li>
       <li>You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for parts of the Git lessons.
