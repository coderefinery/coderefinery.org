### Course goals

The workshop combines insights and teachings from CodeRefinery and Software Carpentry in order to raise awareness of both initiatives. We tailor the workshop to specific needs of the humanities. Researchers, students, educators, and librarians will all find the workshop relevant to their specific interests. The workshop focuses on hands-on experience and will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, version control, and task automation. The core lessons of the workshop are the Software Carpentry’ Programming with Python and CodeRefinery’s Introduction to Version Control with Git.
