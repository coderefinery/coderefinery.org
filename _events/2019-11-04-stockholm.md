### Workshop for present and future instructors

Do you (want to) teach researchers or independent students best
practices of scientific software?
Are you teaching a university course and would like to include
aspects of best practices in software engineering in the course?
Or would you simply like to educate your friends and colleagues in
how to write more reusable, reproducible and better documented code?

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, we welcome you to
join the first CodeRefinery instructor training workshop! This workshop
will focus on how to teach technical topics (e.g. version control with
Git, automated testing or programming languages) in general, and
CodeRefinery lessons in particular. We will cover key pedagogical ideas
and teaching methods, and what you need to know in order to teach the
CodeRefinery lessons. All the material will be firmly grounded in the
experience that CodeRefinery staff has acquired after teaching over 25
workshops to over 600 participants and the published best practices of
the Software Carpentry organization.

One purpose of this workshop is to train CodeRefinery instructors, but
being (or becoming) a CodeRefinery instructor is not required.  People
are equally welcome to learn our tips and tricks and join our informal
Nordic network.  Put another way: *anyone involved in improving the
quality of research code should be here!*

This instructor training workshop will immediate precede a hackathon
event at KTH where researchers are invited to bring their code and data
and work on it collaboratively with other participants.
We would like to bring over ideas from the instructor workshop to the
hackathon, so participants of this workshop are especially encouraged
to attend also the hackathon to work on lesson improvement and development
of new CodeRefinery lessons!
