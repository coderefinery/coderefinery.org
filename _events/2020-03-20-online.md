### Welcome to the CodeRefinery Open House where we discuss and prepare for **online teaching**!

We will meet on [video](https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/152239500) (9:00 am, UTC+1)
and [chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) and discuss techniques,
solutions, and tricks for online teaching and collect our notes in a [shared
document](https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA).

Anyone who would like to contribute or learn is most welcome!

We will conclude the day around 4:00 pm (UTC+1) by writing a short blog/summary
in our [shared document](https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA).
