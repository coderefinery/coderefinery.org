A couple of years ago, [several CodeRefinery members and their
friends](https://neic.no/news/2018/05/04/building-a-community/)
started discussing how a Nordic network of Research Software Engineers
(RSEs) could be established, and soon thereafter the [Nordic-RSE
initiative](https://nordic-rse.org/) was launched. The idea was to
follow in the footsteps of very successful such initiatives in other
countries, most notably in [the UK](https://rse.ac.uk/), [the
Netherlands](http://nl-rse.org/) and
[Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de/index.html). For the past two years
we have been taking the first steps in this direction. A [survey was
conducted](https://github.com/nordic-rse/RSE_intro_survey/blob/master/analysis/results_nordics_2018_narrative.ipynb)
to learn about the environment for people in RSE-related
roles. Information on [groups and people](https://nordic-rse.org/map/)
working in Nordic universities who identify as RSEs is being
collected, and local campaigns have been launched within several
universities for the creation of new RSE groups. To further grow the
emerging Nordic community of RSEs, we are now happy to announce that
**the [first Nordic-RSE conference](https://nordic-rse.org/conference/),
Nordic-RSE2020, will take place in Stockholm between 1st and 2nd
December 2020**!


### About the conference
    
At Nordic-RSE2020, we will bring together those that develop software
for research purposes and contribute to building the RSE
community. The program is not set in stone but we will have invited
talks, lightning talks, poster sessions and workshops on best
practices for creating research software and other popular RSE related
topics. We expect a large contribution from Nordic RSEs, but will also
invite international RSEs that can help our Nordic community take
shape.

The emphasis of the conference will be on learning from each other in
a supportive and relaxed atmosphere. The choice of conference venue
for Nordic-RSE2020, the THS student union building at KTH campus in
Stockholm, reflects our hopes: it has lots of spaces for casual
conversations and is equipped with fast internet and all the
facilities required for a successful conference.
     
### Who should attend?

Our aim is to reflect the diverse and emerging community of RSEs by
seeking input from all levels of experience and across a variety of
domains, genders, and ethnicities.

We welcome participation from:

- Researchers at any career stage who develop software for research
  purposes;
- Software developers working in a research context, whatever their
  job title or field;
- Those interested in advancing the understanding of how best to use
  existing research software (e.g. with respect to scalability,
  performance and/or reproducibility);
- People from any organization providing tools, platforms or services
  that benefit research software;
- Anyone with a stake in research software (funders, publishers,
  decision makers, etc).

We especially encourage first-time presenters and can offer mentoring
and other support with preparing your contribution.
   

### Getting involved

In order to make this a successful conference, we will need help from
volunteers to ensure that all the logistics and practicalities work
smoothly. What's in it for you? All conference helpers get a free
conference ticket! Please get in touch with the organizing committee
(nordic-rse-organizers@neic.no) if you would like to help or if you
have any questions on how to get involved with Nordic-RSE2020.

We will also need sponsors to cover costs, keep the conference fee as
low as possible and to be able to offer travel grants to younger
participants. We have already received generous offers for sponsorship
from the [Swedish e-Science Research Centre
(SeRC)](https://e-science.se/), the [Swedish National Infrastructure
for Computing (SNIC)](https://snic.se/) and the [Swedish e-science
collaboration (eSSENCE)](https://essenceofescience.se/). By supporting
us, our sponsors are helping to raise awareness of the importance of
developing RSE career path in the Nordics.

### Inviting new sponsors

Nordic-RSE2020 is the first networking and community-building event of
Nordic-RSE. We will meet to network, to learn about best software
practices, reproducible research and open science, and to further
develop communication and project management skills required by RSEs.

RSEs are the connection between technology and research. If you want
to get a message directly to those who facilitate research with
technology, you want to sponsor this conference. Our attendees often
shape decisions about tools, contracts and approaches to research
software and computing – either directly or through their role in
advising, training and collaborating with researchers. In addition to
the chance to raise awareness of how your products or services are
relevant to modern research, sponsors will get mentions, visibility,
and depending on the sponsor package chosen, [conference tickets and
contributed workshops, posters or short
talks](https://nordic-rse.org/conference/sponsorship/#sponsor-packages). For
information on sponsorship see [our
webpage](https://nordic-rse.org/conference/sponsorship/) or [get in
touch](nordic-rse-organizers@neic.no).
