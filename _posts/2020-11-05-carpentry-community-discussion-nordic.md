> This blogpost draft is based on the notes made on [Carpentries Community Discussion Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) on the 30th Oct. 2020. 

## Summary

*Although the Carpentries always say "never touch learners keyboard", should instructors rigidly keep this in online workshops? With various features of video conferencing system, can we adobpt the way to teach in Carpentries workshops in a more flexible manner to overcome challenges of online workshops?*

On the 30th October 2020, a Carpentries community discussion was held with discussion focused on Nordic and Baltic countries. The host was Annika Rockenberger (Carpentries instructor trainer). Including the host and the co-host, totally 15 participants joined: 6 from Norway, 3 from Sweden, 3 from Finland, 2 from Denmark, and 1 from Bangladesh (Thanks for joining, all!). A complete list of the participants can be found at the bottom.

First, experiences from 2 online workshops were shared. The theme above is raised as a part of the discussion. The active discussion left little time for other topics, but we had a positive and creative suggestion for further collaboration and community building for Nordic and Baltic region: There was a suggestion for running a joint workshop on AR technology. We got an idea to have a sort of expertise mapping for cross-border collaboration. 

There are ongoing initiatives to develop Nordic community further. Althought time was running out, information about Nordic Research Software Engineer initiative and its first online get-together event on 30th Nov. - 2nd Dec. was announced among others. 


## Workshop debriefing
Experiences from two recently held online Carpentries workshops were shared and discussed. 

### Sweden, Stockholm, Mix and Match (SQL, OpenRefine, Python (programming and plotting))
- [A self-organized workshop by KTH, Stockholm University, and Karolinska Institute](https://linajandren.github.io/2020-09-22-stockholmtrio-online/).
- (Lina, instructor of this workshop) Felt it was hard to teach online, as she was unsure if it reached to the audience. But it went fine. 
- (Radovan) (In his experiences from teaching online workshops in [CodeRefinery](coderefinery.org)) Jumping into breakout rooms to see how the participants did in exercise sessions helped a lot. Also being able to ask/answer questions asynchronously via HackMD hopefully lowers barrier to ask (does not delay others).
- (Annika) Even being able to see helpers' faces would help despite having all the learners camera off. Also, when breakout room size is small, it is easier to get impression of the learners.
### Norway, Bodø, DC social science
- [A centrally-organized workshop at Bodø University](https://mchiapello.github.io/2020-09-16-nord-online/).
- (Lars, instructor of this workshop) Breakout rooms helped as it enhanced dialog. One of the key issues in the Carpentries. Remote control function worked well. The other instructor used this function to help a learner in the main room. It took some time to build trust.
- (Anne) "Taking over learner's keyboard on an in-person workshop should never happen", the Carpentries says! But this concept could be too rigid. This should be given back as feedback to the Carpentries.
- (Lina) Depending on the context?
- (Annika) Communicating the principles and the important parts for not leaving participants behind in critical situation would be the essential thing to consider when taking over keyboard or not.
- (Joakim) Important thing is not give pressure on instructors.
- (Lina) Letting learners take over instructor's screen would be interesting.
- (Lars) Polls for ice-breakers as well. Easy to rush through, but important not to, especially when you cannot see faces as feedback.
- (Radovan) Hopefully useful tips for online teaching learned from CodeRefinery workshops: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/

## Community building, collaboration, and ongoing initiatives in Nordic and Baltic


- (Tobias) Is planning to run a workshop on AR "Let's build an augmented reality web app!" 
    - 3D holiday greeting card: https://arworkshop.teebusch.repl.co/card1.html
    - The lesson material is all there:  https://repl.it/@Teebusch/arworkshop 
- (Joakim) Suggetion of a repository of Carpentries Nordic/Baltic community members with specialities and skills
- (Annika) Google Sheets for this?
- (Anne) EOSC Nordic claims to be a knowledge-hub
- (Radovan) Is also working on mapping.

- **Announcements:** 
    - Nordic RSE (research software engineers) online get-together (Nov 30 - Dec 2): https://nordic-rse.org/events/2020-online-get-together/ (everybody welcome to attend and submit proposals or ideas)
    - Local-nordic Carpentries mailing list: https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-nordic
    - CodeRefinery workshop in November: https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-11-17-online/ (looking for helpers: great way to learn)
