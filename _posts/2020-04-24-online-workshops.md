After cancelling all our planned in-person workshops this spring due
to the ongoing pandemic, we decided to make the best of the situation
and start focusing our efforts on developing an online workshop
training programme. We wanted to start small while learning the
mechanics of online teaching, so we began by offering an online
workshop covering only the
[Git-intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/) lesson to a
group of around 25 participants on April 7-8. Neither teaching nor
attending online workshops offers quite the same experience as
attending in-person events, but we were pleasantly surprised about how
well the workshop went and it definitely gave a boost to our ambitions
to move more of our traditional workshops online. Online workshops will
also provide a means for us to *scale up* and reach a larger audience
than possible with in-person workshops.

We learned many important lessons in this first experiment and we
tried to summarize them all in a [previous
article](https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/04/14/first-online-workshop/). We
hope that these notes can be of help to others who are going online
with some of their teaching.


### New notify-me form

We expect to be delivering many more online workshops also after
covid-19 restrictions are lifted and life starts returning to
normal. We realized that this means that our old notify-me form has
become obsolete - it is no longer enough to only indicate the
city in which you want to attend a workshop. So we created a [new more
fine-grained notify-me
form](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/#notify-me) where
people can sign up for updates about upcoming online and/or in-person
workshops and also indicate which lessons they are most interested
in. If you want to be informed of upcoming workshops, please sign
up.



### Join an online workshops as a helper

The new notify-me form now also has an option to indicate that you are
interested in participating as a helper or instructor.  Instructors
always need help and this is even more relevant for our online
workshops. Helpers assist learners in overcoming technical problems
and work through challenges or questions they may have. Ideally, we
need at least one helper per breakout room (4-5 learners). Helpers
don't have to be familiar with all the lesson material - experience
with even just one lesson/tool/approach is sufficient.

Have you already particated in one or more workshops, and now want to
help us in spreading better software development practices to the world?
Register as **helper** for upcoming online or in-person workshops in our
new [notify-me
form](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/#notify-me). Remember
also that there is no better way to consolidate new knowledge than
teaching it to others!


### Bring your own breakout room/helper

With online courses over video we could in principle aim at reaching a
larger scale than in-person workshops which are limited by room-size
and being visible and audible, but also by the number of helpers. In
online workshops the presence of helpers is no less important to make
sure that each breakout room has a helper to answer questions during
exercise sessions. We are considering to offer participants the
possibility to "bring their own breakout room" to the workshop. This
way they can collaborate on exercises with colleagues they already
know, if they prefer so. More importantly, they can assign one person
who is more experienced in the toolset presented to take the role as
helper. Participating as helper not only means "giving" but is also a
great learning experience: both in the tools and in solving problems
and supporting and teaching other learners.

### Upcoming online workshops

We plan to arrange two full online CodeRefinery workshops covering all
our material before the summer. The format will be to split the
workshop content over six half-days spread over two weeks.

In May we will do our first full CodeRefinery workshop, starting on a
Tuesday, and ending on a Thursday the week after. Drawing on the
experience from this first full workshop, the plan is to deliver a
second online workshop in June.

Sign up for the [notify-me
form](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/#notify-me) if you
want to receive an email as soon as registration opens for these
workshoops!
