<h2 id="about-this-survey">About this survey</h2>
<p>In early 2024 we sent out a survey to participants of our workshops from 2022 and 2023.
We received 129 responses and this blog post summarizes the findings.</p>
<p>You can also browse the
<a href="https://github.com/coderefinery/2024-post-workshop-survey/blob/main/form.pdf">survey questions</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/coderefinery/2024-post-workshop-survey">Jupyter notebook</a> which generated the plots.
We have archived the results <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13292363">on Zenodo</a>.</p>
<p>For each plot we will also provide a summary in text form right below each
plot. Further below you can find answers to free-form questions as well as
suggestions for improvement which we received from the survey participants.</p>
<p>One thing we did not do with the answers was to try to cross-correlate
questions (for instance to correlate feedback with career stage or academic
discipline).</p>
<p>We are very grateful for the feedback and suggestions and we will use them to
improve our workshops in the future. We also appreciate very valuable
input on how to improve survey questions by experts at
RISE Research Institutes of Sweden.</p>

<h2 id="has-anything-else-changed-in-how-you-write-code-for-your-research-after-attending-the-workshop">Has anything else changed in how you write code for your research after attending the workshop?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I started doing documentation in Read the Docs and it really makes the
difference. Thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usage of documentation with sphinx to pages planned, not done for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I learned to use Git and GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimized coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modularity, smaller functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use Git extensively since attending the workshop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub, Bash, Python, and others were very useful even if many things I did
already know in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Especially code documentation improved a lot as a consequence of the course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use Git for myself and it is nice, but I think so much depends on your
supervisors, so ... there is little leverage for me to change things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I don't know how to do something, I use your lesson material as a
reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think I am a lot more confident when writing code now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I write my code so that it is more easier to read by others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I write more cleaner code, I think. I have a better understanding of testing
routines, though haven't incorporated them yet myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commenting and code structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My code is more streamlined and elegant when it comes to reproducibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More comments, splitting files in separate notebooks, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learned to use Git and GitHub better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have changed some of my earlier code to be more "modular", that it is easier
and quicker to run. At least that. Workshop has also made some changes in how I
think about coding, that will probably show in my future work. So, the workshop
felt very useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give more emphasis to code structure (architecture) and adopting a consistent
way of writing code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have gotten better at using functions in code, previously it was much more
script-esque. I have referred several junior colleagues to your workshops as
well (and they've also found them valuable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I try to be tidier but it is hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started using Git.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have improved my reusability and documentation of my codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thank my past self for writing such clear codes now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering the latest workshop, the most important topic for me is the "How
to document your research software". After the workshop, I have used "GitHub
Pages" and "GitHub Actions" for the main documentation of the project that I
am currently working on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I document my code more thoroughly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn't know how to use git version control before. Now I find it so useful!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better documentation + Easier to test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have started writing more modular code and I use git more diligently, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use Git in much more sophisticated way and enjoy it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think more on the potential reader of my code and make it more comprehensible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is hard to tell, since I took CodeRefinery in the beginning in my PhD. I
think the focus on tests and test-driven development has had a good impact on
my coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most important outcome I got from CodeRefinery was learning version control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am way more careful to commit regularly to my repositories and keep track of changes better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No. But I am mainly an experimental scientist. Coding isn't a big part of my work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use Git more consistently and I learned that making my code more easily
understandable does not in fact cost me as much more time as it saves. I have
known that I have room to grow for a long time, but would like to mention
that just the fact that I finally made time for the workshop and I focused on
developing my coding for a few days helped as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I try to write more functions to reuse code for multiple purposes.
Furthermore, I've started using virtual engines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haven't coded a lot since then so hard to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I write self explanatory commit messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I back up in git repositories almost all my code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I try to document my code as I am writing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am just starting to apply the information from "HPC Best Practices." From
previous workshops, it has been a useful reference point to discuss
collaborative workflow with colleagues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My code was always a mess that was meant to be solely my personal playground.
The workshop definitely changed my mindset about it - now I think in the
process of what is the best way to write the code (and comment it) so it can
be used by other people without any (or at least, big) difficulties. I don't
use Git actively at the moment, but it was great to receive the necessary
toolkit for efficiently working with it. I think I will definitely need it at
some point!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've been trying to use Git for all of my projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot has changed on the way how I run code and test it. I attended code
refinery while I was still new to programming so it was difficult to put into
use the learning from code refinery. Now that I actually do coding for my
research, I expect to make the most of the workshop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am using Snakemake now. Right now I think it might not speed up my work
because I am still learning, but I think the benefits will come over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making my codes easier to share, comment them and version control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It maybe not directly related to the code itself but I've learned a lot of new
what is always very beneficial in this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slightly. I was aware of much already in the course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't have a lot of versions of my code anymore. I have my codes in a Git
repository that can be shared with my publications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can write code more compactly and with high performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tend to write more functions with documentation and test units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More testing and better documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I try to create new Git branch for every new line of development to always
have a working version of the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven't been writing a lot of code since the workshop so I haven't really
had a chance to put everything into practice, but I'm trying to create a
project environment for each project and I have been documenting my working
process in RMarkdown notebooks. The notebooks have been really helpful for my
research process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am trying to keep good practices in mind. I am trying to use proper workflows
(raise issue ==&gt; create branch ==&gt; deploy fix ==&gt; push ==&gt; merge request), etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not after this workshop just when I tried it in my own projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use more arrays, which speeds up my work a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I try to use GitHub now. try to do at least some version control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better commenting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has been easier to get to know other's code projects because I have
learned some of the conventions eg. in naming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I use Git for managing the code folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried to follow the rules to make it more reusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am more organised thanks to the use of Git.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More focus on version control and testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My code is still so bad that I haven't benefited from it yet. But I am
definitely going to integrate it. Actually, thanks for asking, I will just
get a few words of advice from my colleague on how best to apply what I
learned at your workshop! :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Made life easier when I work with git tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For me trying to write more readable and reusable code is taking a bit more
time at the moment, but that is because I do not write code very much so I
take a lot of time planning the code and the parts and how they are most
fluently glued together. So I expect it to become easier and take less time
with practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm actively trying to use Git, and back-up my projects (code, useful
articles) in my personal GitHub. I try to update it and, though I've not done
so yet, I intend to use tags to keep track of milestones along the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started using Git on all my projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started using renv to track which version of packages I am using.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forcing myself to write function description prior to actually writing the function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating all code under Git control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trying more modular approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think my code now is modular. The way I organize my repositories reflects
it too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-topic-s-should-we-add-to-our-workshops">What topic(s) should we add to our workshops?</h2>
<p>[Answers like "None", "Nothing", "Everything was on point", etc., are not shown
in the results below.]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More advanced topics on GitLab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hands-on with setting up, training and running AI-models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java for beginners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation with Azure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OOP with Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xarray and/or similar useful libraries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some stuff related to Quantum Computing could be quite interesting. Also some
more "technical computer skills" (how its works by inside, compilations..)
could be interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be good if in the workshop you also showed how to connect GIT to a
private repository on GitHub and later how to synchronize such a connection
with VS Code or RStudio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have not managed, unfortunately, to make git a regular part of my workflow.
For that, I find that a short revision few weeks after the course would be
useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linting/debugging and maybe more time for testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besa training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matlab training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visualisation with Python, Matplotlib of gridded data (thinking about maps,
projections). And also setting up figures with multiple plots. Smart ways to
get reusable code for creating figures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processing of non-linear timestamp data; Combination of float, string, object data in the same data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The actual pieces of code shown were minimal and went quite fast whereas
there was a lot of discussion in very general analogy level which wasn't so
helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could mention VSCode's version control instead of just using the terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git (always useful).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python: managing problem with installation packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python: debug (within some environment: Spyder (?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to use Google Colab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe: Docker / code ocean ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe more on organizing "analysis script" type projects - at least where I
am this is a more common than developing software packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the program was good, but the Git part was most useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the current topics are very good. I felt like the course was a nice
introduction to all the topics, even for the length of it it felt a bit
crowded, so I think it is good as it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VS Code and GitHub Copilot or using AI for coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know that GitLab Pages and GitLab CI have similar workflows but you might
also consider creating some examples for those alternatives as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe something about reproducibility (like Docker containers etc.) or code
publications beyond Zenodo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A small note on how to correctly version-control Jupyter notebooks would be
useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would have been nice to spend a couple of minutes on GitHub Desktop (not
all of us are Terminal fans).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build systems: For example Make or CMake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HPC: What are supercomputers and how to use them. What are GPUs, how to program and use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object Orient Programming (for Python).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of AI tools for coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps package building for Python? Or a practical example of Docker
application? But this is more for a subsequent workshop, I would not remove
anything from the workshop as I attended it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go further on how to browse some else's code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further on recovery options of erroneous commits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bit on debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than additional topics, interactive/exercise segments should be added
after topics to reinforce learning. This was more the case in earlier workshops
than the day 1 HPC best practices workshop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of content covered, although challenging, more concrete examples on
how to find the right amount of memory and CPUs to allocate a job would be
incredibly valuable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the general CodeRefinery workshop, I think a "putting it all together"
unit, including hands-on exercises, would be incredibly helpful, and almost
essential, to see the extent of a baseline application of the knowledge
included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Visual Studio code is quite popular editor it would be good to teach
running Jupyter notebooks in Visual Studio Code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The courses are very complete, perhaps something about dataset sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ML maybe =)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something about docker maybe? It's used more and more in my experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps a couple of more advances focused workshops of advances git to save
time and make it easier to manage code and collaborating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code for publishing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEP 8 style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe for more advanced courses: Object based coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functionalizing a code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it is just right. Adding more may be too overwhelming for a beginner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management in general (partly done already).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would have liked to spend more time on reproducible environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficult to know. I recently would have benefited from knowing more about
(c)cmake, but this becomes very specific. Git is likely the one thing that
has most general applicability from your education suite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More focus on writing statistical code (as opposed to software).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The topics look fine the overall organization of the workshop was a limiting
factor. There were too many participants and it got chaotic due to the
limited number of teachers. Maybe CodeRefinery should focus on quality rather
than on quantity, for instance deliver courses with reduced number of
participants on-line. Also, CodeRefinery can coordinate with universities
where local instructors could teach the courses locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conda environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using pycharm for some code development and version control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More testing and how to switch from chaotic version control to a good one.
Now there is only from scratch, but it would be helpful to go over from
midpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to use Chatgpt to assist coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a IDE for Python programming: Notebook &amp; Git/Github integration, debugging, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Docker or containerization in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How about software design for research? How to write reusable and
maintainable code when you don't know today what you need tomorrow, or when
students, who may have been sole authors, move on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More examples of Pull requests, forks and upstream repositories or local
repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More advanced topics on git collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since I work with R I would have liked to get more R specific information.
But I can see how it can be difficult to add specific info if everyone uses a
different language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conda vs mamba, module management?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code architecture and data repository architecture and management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-topic-s-should-we-remove">What topic(s) should we remove?</h2>
<p>[Answers like "None", "Nothing", "Everything was on point", "All the topics are
relevant", etc., are not shown in the results below.]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The course is very good as it is ...
However, The 6 half days over 2 consecutive weeks  is not very convenient for some people here ...
However, I understand the difficulty to bring together online helpers and instructors.
You are doing a good job ! Keep going !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reproducible research and social coding are a little vague for my taste. So if you need more time, I'd skip them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jupyter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Open Science workshop day has a lot of potential, but there is too little
time with too few interactions with too many topics to make a difference. The
exercises are not very engaging and you did not go deep enough in the aspects
you try to cover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jupyter notebook, because Python is too slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I attended the workshop about Git and was surprised that also other topics
were covered. Maybe have shorter, more focused courses instead of the current
format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first workshop I attended, the general code refinery workshop, I did
not get enough of a grasp on Snakemake, and other tools I understood well
mainly because of prior experience. I think this was a wonderful workshop
that I have repeatedly recommended to my colleagues, but I think more time
should be given to fully try out and cement each tool introduced. I would
roughly add 50-100% more time to the course and spend all the added time on
more live exercise walk-through and coaching while people work on exercises
individually. I would not remove any topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found the basic Git introduction to be rather tedious, so I lost my focus
and motivation. This made it difficult to prioritize attending the final
parts of the workshop over other duties, so I eventually opted out
completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would much prefer an approach were participants are assumed to be at a
somewhat competent level from the get-go. Preparation material could be
provided ahead of time for the beginners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe automated testing and modular coding to put that in a separate workshop about improving coding practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation was a lot of things in a very short time. I say just choose one
of the documentation options to explain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of them. Or split the topic of collaborative programming (Day 1 to 3)
and documentation (Day 4 to 6) to two separate courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't think anything should be removed...maybe a second workshop that goes into more depth on reproducibility?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How about you ask registrants to pick their three/five/x favorite topics from
a list upon registration, and you select the N most popular ones? Perhaps
makes it more difficult to prepare, and perhaps makes it more difficult for
participants to commit, but since participation (at least online) is a
relatively low commitment, maybe it is okay anyway?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe a small practice session for some of the presenters - a few of the
presenters could improve their communication skills. I know it is a small
thing, but just adding 10-20% humor or more energy into a presentation can
really significantly affect the learning output for students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For me personally the Jupyter notebooks session was less helpful. But that
doesn't mean it should necessarily be removed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-feedback">Other feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let me highlight it here: your format is great!
The features I liked in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>HackMD and very high quality feedback there</li>
<li>type-along sessions</li>
<li>dialogue between the two teachers as a format of the lecture.
Many thanks for your effort!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was great that I could watch the few sessions that O unfortunately couldn't attend on video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks a lot for organizing these super useful workshops
and for promoting/creating a environment very relaxed and inclusive
learning environment.</p>
</li>
