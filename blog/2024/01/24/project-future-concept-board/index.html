    <hr>

    <p>On January 23, 2024, we held a meeting where we wanted to explore <strong>ideas for
the future of the CodeRefinery project</strong> from team members and the community.</p>
<p>In most meetings only very few people speak and most participants don't say
anything.  We wanted to change this and tried to create a welcoming meeting
environment with a facilitator who hopefully only facilitates and meeting
participants where hopefully everybody gets the chance to contribute. We used a
concept board and collected ideas visually (screenshots are below).</p>
<p>In this post we summarize our findings and lessons learned. If you only have 3
minutes, then read the summary (first section).</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="meeting-format-and-goals">Meeting format and goals</h2>
<p>To facilitate a meeting where we collect ideas from everybody but without
judging them, we used a concept board and virtual sticky notes and divided the
session into 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with everybody taking notes by themselves ("me"; for ourselves).</li>
<li>Second step: formalize and place on concept board ("we"; randomized 1-1
pairs).</li>
<li>Third step: we review and discuss as a group ("us"). Make sure that the
facilitator understood what the group wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>13 persons participated in this meeting (one of them, the author of this blog
post, was the facilitator):
<img width="100%" src="/blog/project-future-concept-board/participants.jpg" alt="screenshot of sticky notes with participant names"></p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li>5 min: welcome and getting started</li>
<li>5 min: everyone adds themselves to the board</li>
<li>10 min "me" time: work on your own on the two boards below, without sharing your thoughts yet</li>
<li>15 min "we" time: 1-1 work with a randomized partner; put ideas on the board(s)</li>
<li>10 min "us" time: we cluster and organize</li>
<li>10 min: voting on which ideas are most important for you (everybody got 10 votes to distribute)</li>
<li>follow-up: blog post summarizing this</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a screenshot from the session:
<img width="100%" src="/blog/project-future-concept-board/timeline.jpg" alt="screenshot of the meeting timeline and meeting suggestions"></p>
<h2 id="concept-boards-where-we-explored-what-project-members-need-and-want-from-the-project">Concept boards where we explored what project members need and want from the project</h2>
<p>Meeting participants were asked to answer two questions with sticky notes
(sticky note color has no meaning):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Needs"</strong>: In your current position, what do you need in order to be able
to contribute to the project 1 year from now? (in terms of work time,
financing, governance, administration, accounting, leadership, credit)</li>
<li><strong>"Wants"</strong>: What do you wish from the project in terms of lesson portfolio,
format, and collaboration in order to still be around 1 year from now?</li>
</ul>
<p>We did not have enough time to cluster the notes better but to summarize the
findings I have later manually clustered related votes and summed them up.</p>
<img width="100%" src="/blog/project-future-concept-board/vote.jpg" alt="screenshot of the sticky notes with ideas and number of votes">
<p>The comment note that is outside that screenshot to the bottom and looks a bit
cut off says:
"I agree with this a way that CR should have a more defined brand - be it HPC or something else".</p>
<p>Below we list the ideas also in text format.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Needs</strong>: In your current position, what do you need in order to be able to contribute to the project 1 year from now? (in terms of work time, financing, governance, administration, accounting, leadership, credit)</p>
<ul>
<li>Company internal cost object for in-kind contribution</li>
<li>Staff in my own project that are interested in working on CR</li>
<li>A project in my organisation  that somehow includes CR</li>
<li>Official statement of how CR fits in the ecosystem of FAIR X, to help convincing management if they say "we do already Y"</li>
<li>collaborations with different people on varied topic for training and workshop, and also seeking more opportunities for future development</li>
<li>Measurable benefit to Aalto (continued enrollment numbers)</li>
<li>formalize contribution to the outside (credit to contributors)</li>
<li>Subject overlap with skills and tools of relevance for HPC</li>
<li>HPC connection</li>
<li>Possibility to allocate (more) worktime for this</li>
<li>"cost object" either via project funding or formalized "in-kind"</li>
<li>Collaboration with passionate people who enjoys delivering, two way learning</li>
<li>"Project" that includes CR as a job</li>
<li>a strong publication or white paper about CR and its importance/benefits</li>
<li>Plans for the future public and concrete, roadmap</li>
<li>Tasks that have clear work-time estimations</li>
<li>UPPMAX &amp; NAISS provide in-kind support: this has worked really well up to now, but it is dependent on the home organization to have a secure funding</li>
<li>(this is a need/want) New content? New formats? Experiment beyond the usual tools workshop</li>
<li>If outside regular job then some other compensation for my time</li>
<li>Permission from supervisor</li>
<li>possibility to join as "oneself",without organization that is "part of CR"</li>
<li>collect and showcase where else than within the CR project, the materials are used -&gt; show benfit, visibility to employer</li>
<li>Recognition of our good teaching practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wants</strong>: What do you wish from the project in terms of lesson portfolio, format, and collaboration in order to still be around 1 year from now?</p>
<ul>
<li>UPPMAX &amp; NAISS perspective: In terms of collaboration, the fact that this is a collaboration among people from several supercomputing centers makes it more valuable / "sells" better to higher ups. That is not to exclude industry, but main target audience for us/UPPMAX is academic users.</li>
<li>More frequent social events eg. monthly zoomffee / networking events</li>
<li>thinking more topics for training via discussion  &amp; collaboration</li>
<li>Self learning materials/courses/ asynchronous learning: some researchers don't have time for long workshops and don't wanna know all the details</li>
<li>social events where team members get an overview of activities in  each partner organization</li>
<li>CR MOOC as basic service, interaction/teams delegated</li>
<li>smaller shorter  workshops</li>
<li>New training material topics</li>
<li>Have "phone generation" suitable materials , eg IQM academy style</li>
<li>National course/workshop collaborations, offering in -person specialized short workshops</li>
<li>more in-person teaching</li>
<li>New topics on AI and ML can be added to CR lesson portfolio</li>
<li>official network of teachers, public on webpage, with skills</li>
<li>stronger integration with HPC - if CR should "belong" somewhere, it should be HPC</li>
<li>UPPMAX &amp; NAISS perspective: In terms of lessons, the base workshop is great. I think new lessons should be created in terms of needs and existing/wish-for expertise. CR has enabled collaboration on additional courses that are complimentary to the ones of the home institution - added value.</li>
<li>co-organizing events</li>
<li>course collaborations of courses that already exiost, like currently done with Aalto HPC kcikstart</li>
<li>formalized and more official course request form, to show organizations (in and outside of CR) that this is "a thing"</li>
<li>Have more formalized possibility of using readymade computing environment "executable website"</li>
<li>regular BoF sessions at conferences like ISC, SC, PyCon, JuliaCon, etc</li>
<li>programming lessons to go hand-in-hand with software engineering lessons</li>
<li>Co-hosting of events, and co-developing of lessons, with PDC/NAISS</li>
<li>mechanism/support for creating new "refineries" (HPC Refinery, AI Refinery, ...)</li>
<li>Develop training material for GPU computing</li>
<li>volunteer instructors for CR and instructor training workshops</li>
<li>Easy way to follow what is going on and when to step in. (Something else than scrolling all chat)</li>
<li>stronger connection to other similar projects, like BSSW, INTERSECT, etc</li>
<li>UPPMAX &amp; NAISS perspective: As for the format, in my opinion going even
larger in attendance would imply using a platform like LinkedIn or similar.
But it does require additional effort, at least in the setup phase. This
would allow for asyncrohonous learning. The danger I see with it is that it
may not be appealing for the home institution.</li>
<li>maintenance and further development of sphinx-lesson</li>
<li>Collaborators on video-material (should we choose to make some)</li>
<li>collaboration &amp; flexibility, promote two way learning</li>
<li>Connection to RSE community somehow</li>
<li>Delegate nonprofit side to DRA (for example)</li>
<li>Denmark could use with another CR person</li>
<li>Less lesson revision each workshop</li>
<li>up-to-date and maintained lessons</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-we-learned-about-the-meeting-format">What we learned about the meeting format</h2>
<p>The format felt like the right choice. However we noted few suggestions
for how we can improve such meetings in future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allocate 1.5 hours instead of 1 hour.</li>
<li>Add a break so that facilitator can organize boards to make it easier for all.</li>
<li>Add example sticky notes.</li>
<li>Suggest to make text short (some sticky notes contained too many words and
were possibly not read during the 5 minute voting session).</li>
</ul>
