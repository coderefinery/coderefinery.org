<h2 id="coderefinery-started-8-years-ago">CodeRefinery started 8 years ago</h2>
<p>In October 2024 the CodeRefinery project was celebrating the conclusion of its
8th year of existence.  During that time about 9 online and 28 in-person
workshops were held by ~30 instructors, organizers and facilitators teaching
good enough research software engineering practices to ~3000 participants from
~20 countries, of many scientific fields, career stages and preferred
programming languages.  We would like to celebrate this achievement with you,
by looking back at the history and achievements unlocked over the years and
also ask you to share your best memories.  Spoiler: Even though this is a
"looking back" post, CodeRefinery will not cease to exist anytime soon if we
can help it.  We'd just like to celebrate the project and highlight the
contributions of key members.</p>
<p>The project grew out of an initially local course (given at KTH Stockholm in
2014 and 2015) and in 2016 became a Nordic project.  Rossen Apostolov (KTH
Stockholm) submitted a proposal to the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration
(NeIC) in 2015 and NeIC quickly recognized it as a potentially impactful
project worth co-funding. The project was started in 2016, under the leadership
of Radovan Bast, project manager of CodeRefinery for the whole duration of the
project.</p>
<p>Thor Wikfeldt remembers: "[...] I have had the privilege of working with
Radovan Bast since 2016 when the CodeRefinery project was launched, and I
joined under his leadership.  Among all the highly competent individuals I have
encountered in my career, Radovan stands out for his relentless dedication and
selfless commitment to making a meaningful impact on the world.  He has
inspired me to not only become a better teacher and developer of training
materials but also to be more productive, collaborative and generous in my
professional life.  Radovan took CodeRefinery from a mere concept to a
pioneering educational project that is now well- known not only in the Nordic
region (where it started) but globally. [...] "</p>
<h2 id="what-is-coderefinery">What is CodeRefinery?</h2>
<p>CodeRefinery acts as a hub for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable) software practices. It currently focuses on the Nordic/Baltic
countries, but aims to expand beyond this region.  CodeRefinery aims to operate
as a community project with support from academic organizations. The project
started in 2016 and has developed a broad curriculum of openly maintained and
reviewed lessons, has taught hundreds of participants across all academic
disciplines, and has managed to build a community of instructors, learners,
team leads (who help learners during exercises), expert helpers (who support
team leads), local organizers and partner organizations.</p>
<p>The project idea/directive grew out of two courses given at PDC/KTH in 2014 and
2015, which focused on research software engineering tools and techniques.  The
courses were popular and it was clear that the demand is not limited to the
Stockholm region and we approached NeIC to bring this project to a Nordic
level, both to have more impact, but also to connect instructors across Nordic
borders.  The first CodeRefinery workshop was given late 2016 and since then
the lesson material has evolved a lot and we have delivered many more
workshops, both in-person and online.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery has established itself as a highly successful initiative that
improves coding skills at an intermediate level, bridging the gap between
Software Carpentry for beginners, and the more advanced/bespoke training
offered by other universities and HPC/computational research initiatives.</p>
<p>The objectives of the CodeRefinery project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize and deliver workshops and events</li>
<li>Develop and maintain a lesson portfolio</li>
<li>Build a community and network of instructors and volunteer helpers</li>
<li>Operate a Nordic GitLab service</li>
<li>Support the community of Nordic research software engineers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coderefinery-workshops">CodeRefinery workshops</h2>
<p>The CodeRefinery project provides open, reusable and self-learning ready lesson
materials developed by experts from different countries, organizations and
scientific backgrounds.  CodeRefinery focuses on maintaining collaboration in
lesson development, teaching and workshop organization. Workshops with multiple
roles especially highlight the value of collaborative efforts.</p>
<p>The workshops are focused around exercises and discussions and participants are
encouraged to form teams for these sessions.  The learning outcomes for each
lesson are defined and shared in the beginning of each lesson.</p>
<p>We kindly request feedback from participants after each workshop day. Feedback
is gathered using known tools with no separation between workshop and feedback.
If necessary and possible, given feedback is already implemented for the next
workshop day.</p>
<p>The CodeRefinery project maintains manuals with a collection of work processes
and ideas (<a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/">https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/</a>).  It summarizes how
meetings, workshops and other topics work and serves as basis for e.g. the
helper onboarding for the workshop.</p>
<h2 id="bring-your-own-classroom">Bring your own classroom</h2>
<p>When switching from in-person to online workshops the CodeRefinery team put a
lot of effort in embracing the online workshop format. A lot of thought has
been put into our online hand-on, demo and screen sharing setups in order to
provide the best possible learning experience to participants.</p>
<p>Since 2020 we had multiple local classrooms join our workshop and have adapted
the format to accommodate these special circumstances.</p>
<p>Paula Martinez Lavanchy shares: "[...][W]e have been ‘bringing our own class’ to
the CodeRefinery workshops by joining the streaming of the lessons from the classroom with
our participants and helpers.
TU Delft researchers provided very positive feedback about this initiative reflected in
comments such as:</p>
<p>“It's great and extremely useful. If it was it for me I would make it mandatory knowledge. It's
really important that TU Delft continues promoting these workshops.”</p>
<p>“Excellent workshop: the graduate school would be so much better with more of these
practical &amp; technical workshops”</p>
<p>The CodeRefinery initiative has helped us and benefit TU Delft researchers in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The possibility of joining the workshops allowed us to advance with the
implementation of our Vision for Research Data &amp; Software management training
and the implementation of TU Delft Research Software Policy by providing high
quality and well-received training on FAIR software practices.•</li>
<li>The involvement of our data stewards, software engineers and trainers as helpers in
the CodeRefinery workshops have also provided them with a great opportunity to
continuously improve their skills and learn from this great community.</li>
<li>The CodeRefinery learning materials are openly available and of excellent quality.
We often refer our researchers to use them as consultation materials on our websites
and/or guides.
[...]"</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sharing-experiences-and-support-for-doing-your-own-thing">Sharing experiences and support for doing your own thing</h2>
<p>But the CodeRefinery project does not only focus on own workshops, it also
wants to make it easier for others to provide clean and functional lesson
materials with all the features needed for computational topics by providing a
public lesson template (<a href="https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson">https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson</a>).  In
addition, the ways that teaching has worked well for CodeRefinery are shared
through train the trainer workshops, which have been presented in different
forums and to various groups (<a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/">https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/</a>).</p>
<p>The lesson development process always involves multiple experts. All
discussions and reviews are public and can be found on our GitHub pages
(<a href="https://github.com/coderefinery">https://github.com/coderefinery</a>).</p>
<p>Since it is free and open to reuse, there is no full overview about who has
reused CodeRefinery materials. But when talking to people at conferences and
other events we often get to hear that teachers are happily reusing the
CodeRefinery materials for their lectures.</p>
<p>Two larger programs that have been built on top of CodeRefinery materials are
the Netherlands eScience Center workshop on "Good practices in research
software development"
(<a href="https://www.esciencecenter.nl/event/good-practices-in-research-software-development-5/">https://www.esciencecenter.nl/event/good-practices-in-research-software-development-5/</a>)
and the "EuroCC best practices in HPC training" program lead by ENCCS Sweden
(<a href="https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/">https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/</a>).</p>
<p>Mateusz Kuzak and his team from the Netherlands eScience center explain:</p>
<p>"[...] At the Center, we have been successfully using the training materials
developed by the CodeRefinery project since 2020. At that time, CodeRefinery
filled the gap in the intermediate research software skills for researchers.
We already delivered training based on the Carpentries and were looking for
more advanced content for researchers already doing some programming. What I
appreciate about the project is that Radovan and others didn’t just reinvent
everything. They build the Trainer the Trainer programme on top of excellent
Carpentries Instructor Training.  They also realised that the pedagogical
methodology used by the Carpentries, heavily dependent on live coding, would
not work that well for intermediate audiences.  They developed a curriculum
rich in independent work on complex exercises. At the eScience Center, we found
that approach more effective for less novice learners. CodeRefinery was also
very innovative, introducing a distributed online approach with many helpers
supporting locally or in online breakout rooms. I believe that helps with
scaling the course and reaching a new audience that otherwise wouldn't be able
to access this training. We at the eScience Center will continue reusing and
contributing to the CodeRefinery project. [...]"</p>
<h2 id="more-than-just-workshops">More than just workshops</h2>
<p>The main CodeRefinery workshop is organized twice a year and it is free and
open for everyone. Everyone is encouraged to ask their questions and discuss
the topics that interest them in a collaborative document. Instructors have a
variety of different scientific and cultural backgrounds and are in different
stages in their career.<br />
After each workshop participants are encouraged to
join the community which mainly lives in the CodeRefinery Zulip chat that to
date is a home to 446 people with about 10% being really active.  The chat is
also home to the Nordic-RSE and Nordic-HPC communities which are tightly knit
with CodeRefinery. The chat serves as a space for planning, support and
discussions around different topics. Participants of the CodeRefinery workshops
are encouraged to use the chat also beyond the workshop to ask their questions
around workshop topics and beyond. Some participants even have found their way
into the project this way.</p>
<p>While the workshops are the main event for CodeRefinery, it is also a community
with an open heart for supporting research computing and providing courses on a
researchers level.  Research Software Hour was born from the community, and has
brought topics of Research Software Engineering that you cannot teach in a
class to the research community (<a href="https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/">https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/</a>).</p>
<p>A Zenodo community is available to collect all CodeRefinery and CodeRefinery related outputs:

<p>Project members have been actively seeking opportunities to spread the word and
share the experiences from running the CodeRefinery workshops at conferences in
the research computing world.  Among others the project has been presented at
Supercomputing (SC) conference in the US, International SuperComputing (ISC) in
Germany, SIAM, RSECon and CarpentryCon in recent years.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>We are currently in the third round of funding by NeiC (one person to
coordinate the efforts, other partners support in-kind) and considering our
next steps.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: CodeRefinery will not end or cease to exist.</p>
<p>We are in contact with funders and past and potential future organizations to
make these efforts go on and likely we will continue the funded coordination +
in-kind partners model. For other structures we may collaborate with other
organizations and projects.</p>
<p>If this project and its mission sounds like something you would like to join or
support, we have multiple ways to get involved from spreading the word as an ambassador, supporting material and workshop format development, becoming an instructor and teaching with us to organizing workshops with us or on your own. Please contact support@coderefinery.org or join our chat (<a href="https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/">https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/</a>) and we can discuss in more
detail.</p>
