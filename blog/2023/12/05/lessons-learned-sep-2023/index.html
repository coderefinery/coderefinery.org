    <p>After each workshop we try to collect feedback and lessons learned from team
members, learners, local organizers, and stakeholders.  These documents help us
preparing future workshops and events and serve as our <strong>organizational
memory</strong> so that we don't forget important observations six months later. Below
we summarize our lessons learned from our <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/">September 2023
workshop</a>.</p>
<p>But let us first start with a nice feedback we received:</p>

        </ul>
    

<h2 id="material">Material</h2>
<p>The team has done amazing work preparing a high-quality material:</p>
<ul>
<li>"We've really enjoyed the material (even without the video, it was good to
follow all the tutorials you provided. Some coworkers could not attend the
workshop but did the exercises on their own. They found the material so
nice that they've shared it to their students.)."</li>
<li>"The written course materials are really fantastic. I had to review some
aspects of Git/GitHub myself before the session, and the online notes made
that much more efficient."</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="role-of-helpers-exercise-leaders">Role of helpers/ exercise leaders</h2>
<ul>
<li>The role of local helpers seems more crucial before and after, than during the workshop.</li>
<li>The bigger the course, the more likely we will see questions that are
answered in install instructions. This supports the previous point.</li>
<li>Local groups see the benefit from nurturing a local community of
trainees of the CodeRefinery courses.</li>
<li>"During the course I think you are already doing a wonderful job."</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-improve-exercises">How to improve exercises</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider collecting some feedback between the explanation and start of the
exercise. For example, having the attendees take part in one of these
interactive online group quizzes. That provides some immediate review of the
ideas and gives you feedback on anything that needs clarified.</li>
<li>For the GitHub forking exercise, consider demonstrating using a split-screen
simultaneously showing the two roles on one screen.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="providing-a-zoom-to-work-on-exercises-together">Providing a Zoom to work on exercises together</h2>
<p>This time we have again decided to provide a central Zoom for learners who are
not part of a team to work on exercises together with others.  However, this
was mostly unused and we were unsure why precisely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea for next time: instead of us providing Zoom where nobody shows up, we
offer that we can be invited to local group Zoom and they call us in.</li>
<li>With self-organised Zoom: we got no contact to those who indicate "interest
in being an EL/TL but don't have team ready”. If we keep the Zoom, those
people could be instructed to go straight to that Zoom + usual mention about
the on-boarding.</li>
<li>Consider providing Zoom only after the streaming has stopped for end of the
day live clarifications, Q&amp;A, etc. This in practice already happened in the live
room where after the streaming people had more questions. Downside: It can
be tiring after a long day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="helping-learners-to-navigate-and-find-where-we-are">Helping learners to navigate and find where we are</h2>
<p>When following the different windows and at the same time listening to the
stream it is easy to get distracted for a minute and miss where we are right
now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each exercise/type along on a new topic can start with "Check your current
directory. Decide where you want to be for the next part."</li>
<li>We should have a graphical prompt/box on the stream somewhere which says what
people should do: "watch", "type along", "continue with XYZ".</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-setup">Technical setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't use new streaming setup without good advance practice. We had some behind-the-scenes
hiccups the first day, but without impact on learners or the course quality.</li>
<li>Self-hosted HedgeDoc seems to work really well. We observed no technical
issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="audio-quality-is-super-important">Audio quality is super important</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use a headset. Podcast-quality microphone on the desk was
not enough and when switching to a headset, quality improved significantly.</li>
<li>Headset should be wired or via a dedicated dongle (Bluetooth has too much
latency).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-main-as-the-default-branch">Using "main" as the default branch</h2>
<p>This was our first workshop where we have asked participants to configure Git
to use <code>main</code> as the default branch instead of <code>master</code> to avoid confusion when
moving from laptop to GitHub. We did this after a lot of thinking and waiting
because we knew that some learners have old versions of Git and sometimes no
possibility to upgrade. Trying to make sure that our instructions and exercises
work on "all" Git versions we chose to initialize Git using <code>git init -b main</code>.
However, that command unfortunately failed on older Git versions to our
surprise. We did not consider that possibility when testing and preparing.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the next workshop reconsider the default and provide a safety net. But
also see the discussion
below about "Should we start with the command line?" which might make this
problem go away in a different way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-git-switch-restore-instead-of-checkout">Using git switch/restore instead of checkout</h2>
<p>This change seems to have worked without problems.</p>
<h2 id="should-we-start-with-the-command-line">Should we start with the command line?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Command line seems to be a too big of a barrier to install and learn. We are
wondering whether command line should not be a separate course and we should
try to not expect it.</li>
<li>Consider starting the Git lesson not from the command line but from an IDE or from the web.</li>
<li>Consider starting with cloning and improve a repo first (instead of <code>git init</code> as the first step).</li>
<li>Already for this workshop we have provided a "web-based track" parallel to
the command line track as safety net in case command line does not work. This was
useful and should be developed further.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="timetable">Timetable</h2>
<p>Here is a list of suggestions we got on how to improve the selection of topics
and the timetable.</p>
<p>To improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1 felt too slow. Idea: "if you are able to do X and Y and Z, you can join
from day 2".</li>
<li>Sometimes it was too slow, too long to explain concept.</li>
<li>Modular code part too much demo, too little participation, not practical enough.</li>
<li>Snakemake part did not seem to fit into the flow, it felt out of place (good
to know that it exists but might not use it in future; same feeling for
helpers).</li>
<li>It would be interesting to hear about best practices about how to write code
(in a way that others can understand it).</li>
<li>Idea: colorize an example code to identify room for improvement, e.g.
repetition (but that is difficult to do online).</li>
<li>During demo-heavy lessons it is difficult to have interaction and discussion
in the room (contributes to the feeling that it is not practical).</li>
<li>Git collaboration: instead of discussing the collaboration figures, show an
animation or steps or visual aids - otherwise it can be confusing trying to
grasp it all.</li>
<li>Day 2 felt like lots of downtime (long exercises, breaks, too little time "real lesson").</li>
<li>Streaming and in-person interaction is not easy to manage.</li>
<li>More practical exercises needed in second week.</li>
<li>"On the second week, it was a bit more difficult to know if the tools
presented would be useful for us."</li>
<li>Stream/exercise-combo works well for Git (first week) but less well for second week.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The first week on Git was very good, all the people that attended were
already familiar with Git (they've at least heard of it or used a bit). We
still have discovered some tips and now we have a better foundation about
Git."</li>
<li>Which days most useful? Documentation and Jupyter, then followed by Git intro day 2.</li>
<li>In-person participation was appreciated.</li>
<li>It was appreciated to see that programming is not just about programming
(also about documentation and communication).</li>
<li>The lunch break division was globally an improvement (although it also made
some days feel like there were too many breaks).</li>
<li>Longer break between sessions makes sure that session 1 does not eat time
away from session 2.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mooc-ify-the-workshop">MOOC-ify the workshop?</h2>
<p>We are considering pre-recording sessions in smaller chunks and also pre-record
exercise solutions. We still want to provide an event-feeling but perhaps this
can be done with a MOOC, a "flipped-classroom approach", and more focus on
answering questions and bring-your-own-code sessions (see also below)?</p>
<ul>
<li>Streaming workshop was excellent solution during pandemic but we need to check whether this is still good fit.</li>
<li>MOOC could be an interesting format.</li>
<li>It could relieve some organization effort during the event at the cost of
spreading the preparation over a longer time period.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bring-your-own-code-sessions">Bring-your-own-code sessions</h2>
<p>This was the first workshop where we scheduled two follow-up sessions, one week
after and two weeks after, where learners could bring their own code and ask
questions about how to apply the course to their code and research.
Unfortunately no learners showed up to these sessions. Our recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule bring your own code session already in week 2 and then with more
time after the workshop.</li>
<li>More active advertising, earlier in the workshop.</li>
<li>Give examples for problems to bring</li>
<li>Offer at different time slots.</li>
<li>Consider coupling advertising with workshop survey.</li>
</ul>
