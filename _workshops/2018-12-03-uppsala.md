goals:
    The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize
    the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research
    software development. The main focus is on professional tools
    for efficiently developing and maintaining research software.
    Since most research code is developed in a collaborative
    setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate
    this process. Most of the content is also relevant to
    a single developer.
