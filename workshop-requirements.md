## Lecture room

- The room needs to be sufficiently large (a typical workshop is attended by
  around 20 learners and 4 instructors).
- There needs to be enough space for instructors to walk around and interact
  with learners individually (a "flat" room is required).
- Learners should face the same direction, and learners should be able to sit
  side-by-side for pairwise work.
- The room should preferably have windows, and be ventilated well enough so
  that 20-30 people (and same amount of laptops) will not make it too warm.
- A coffee room (or similar) should be located nearby for the coffee breaks.
- Two overhead projectors are desirable, but if only one is available that will
  work too.
- The projector screen needs to be large, and the resolution of the projector
  needs to be good.
- Stable wireless connectivity for 20-30 people.
- Sufficiently many electricity outlets so that all participants can charge
  their laptops.
- Standing board for instructor.

## Helpers

CodeRefinery workshops are hands-on and interactive, and a lot of time is 
spent on exercises where participants learn by doing. 
It is therefore highly desirable that each workshop have a few 
workshop "helpers" who can work with the instructors in assisting participants 
with the exercises.   
Local organizers are requested to suggest names for 
possible workshop helpers. Good candidates are people who:
- are research software engineers or hold a similar technical research position
- have attended a previous CodeRefinery workshop
- have experience from teaching e.g. Software Carpentry workshops
- have a passion for teaching, scientific software development, open source, open science, etc.



## Other requirements

When we organize a workshop or event at a new site, we may need help with some local arrangements,
including:

- Booking a lecture room.
- Ordering coffee and refreshments.
- Advertise the workshop through local dissemination channels.
