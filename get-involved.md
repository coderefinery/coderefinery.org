CodeRefinery is always looking for both people and institutions that can promote the FAIRness of software managemeng and development practice. There are many ways that you can get involved.

### Become a workshop helper

Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but
would like to attend another one to refresh your memory and share your own
knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background in research software
engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly
environment? Join a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop as a helper! [Get in
touch](/get-involved/#contact-us) and let us know which workshop you would like to join. For more information about what a helper is supposed to do, please refer [Helper’s guide](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/helping-and-teaching.md)


### Become a CodeRefinery workshop instructor
<!--- I am quite unsure if this is OK enough. Especially the order of the paragraphs. Please modify to make it most reasonable--->

You are welcome to self-organize a CodeRefinery workshop or join as an instructor in a workshop organized by others. Please watch out recruitment of instructors in #workshop stream of [CodeRefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com). 

Although at the moment there is no strict requirements to become a CodeRefinery instructor, we strongly encourage you to attend either a 2-day [Carpentry instructor training event](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), CR instructor training, or (even better), both. Please
[get in touch](mailto:support@coderefinery.org) if this sounds interesting.

For more information about organizing a workshop, please refer to [CodeRefinery workshop administration guide](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/workshop-administration.md).

### Become a Carpentries workshop instructor

[NeIC reserves 15 seats per year for Carpentries instructor training](https://neic.no/training). Please
[get in touch](mailto:support@coderefinery.org) for more information if this sounds interesting.

After taking the instructor training, you are welcome to self-organize a Carpentries workshop or join a workshop as an instructor when instructors are recruited via  #workshop stream of [CodeRefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com).


### Contribute to teaching material

All our lessons are [on GitHub](https://github.com/coderefinery). Contributions
to the lesson material are highly welcome! The best way to contribute is via
the forking-pull request workflow. See our lesson on [collaborative version
control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/02-distributed/) for
an overview of how this works. You can also [contact us](/get-involved/#contact-us) via other
channels.

### Become an institutional partner as a training hub

Coderefinery started as a sponsored and funded project, but we are
encouraging more partnerships to stay sustainable long-term.  In
general, we image a reciprocal relationship for academic institutions:
you help us run workshops, we give workshops at your institution.

Please take a look at [training hubs page](https://coderefinery.org/about/hubs/) for more information.
