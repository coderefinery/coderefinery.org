CodeRefinery consists of two parts: an **open source project**
producing lesson material openly, and a **publically funded Nordic
project** to give these workshops in the Nordics.  Anyone may join the
open source project as equal partners to the Nordic project.

CodeRefinery is always looking for both people and institutions that can promote the FAIRness of software managemeng and development practice. There are many ways that you can get involved.  You can check out our [manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/), in particular the [about us](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/the-project/) and [contributing](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/contributing/) pages, for more about us.

We are in the same galaxy as the [Carpentries
organization](https://carpentries.org/) and closely work with them. We
run our workshops in a slightly different way, but our general
philosophy, lesson material, and procedures are interchangeable. Our
lessons should be considered Carpentries lessons.

### Become a workshop helper

Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but
would like to attend another one to refresh your memory and share your own
knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background in research software
engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly
environment? Join a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop as a helper! [Get in
touch](/get-involved/#contact-us) and let us know which workshop you would like to join. For more information about what a helper is supposed to do, please refer [Helperâ€™s guide](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/helping-and-teaching/)


### Become a CodeRefinery workshop instructor
<!--- I am quite unsure if this is OK enough. Especially the order of the paragraphs. Please modify to make it most reasonable--->

You are welcome to self-organize a CodeRefinery workshop or join as an instructor in a workshop organized by others. Please watch out recruitment of instructors in #workshop stream of [CodeRefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/).

Although at the moment there is no strict requirements to become a CodeRefinery instructor, we strongly encourage you to attend either a 2-day [Carpentry instructor training event](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), CR instructor training, or (even better), both. Please
[get in touch](mailto:support@coderefinery.org) if this sounds interesting.

For more information about organizing a workshop, please refer to [CodeRefinery workshop administration guide](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/workshop-administration/).

### Become a Carpentries workshop instructor
<!--- I am quite unsure if this is OK enough. Especially the order of the paragraphs. Please modify to make it most reasonable--->

If you would like to become an instructor for Carpentries, you should begin by participating in a 2-day [Carpentry instructor training event](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
<!--need to revise the URL -->
[NeIC reserves 15 seats per year for Carpentries instructor training](https://neic.no/training). Please
[get in touch](mailto:support@coderefinery.org) for more information if this sounds interesting.

After taking the instructor training, you are welcome to self-organize a Carpentries workshop or join a workshop as an instructor when instructors are recruited via  #workshop stream of [CodeRefinery Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/).


### Contribute to teaching material

All our lessons are [on GitHub](https://github.com/coderefinery). Contributions
to the lesson material are highly welcome! The best way to contribute is via
the forking-pull request workflow. See our lesson on [collaborative version
control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/02-distributed/) for
an overview of how this works. You can also [contact us](/get-involved/#contact-us) via other
channels.


### Reuse our material

We very much encourage reusing our lessons and contributing changes: [github.com/coderefinery](https://github.com/coderefinery/)

### Become an institutional partner as a training hub

Coderefinery started as a sponsored and funded project, but we are
encouraging more partnerships to stay sustainable long-term.  In
general, we image a reciprocal relationship for academic institutions:
you help us run workshops, we give workshops at your institution.

Please take a look at [training hubs page](https://coderefinery.org/about/hubs/) for more information.
